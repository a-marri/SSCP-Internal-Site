### How to Find Summer House Rentals

Check theNetwork.io this a site where MBA students from selective schools around the US post apartments that they want to rent. You can filter by university to look at houses that Stanford MBAs are renting.

Try SUPost.com, Craigslist, etc. There are sites such as padmapper that do a nice job of making craigslist data easier to search through

The GSB students often put together a Google Doc of houses that they want to sublet during the summer. In 2013 theNetwork.io replaced the google docs, but it is possible that in the future the GSB students may return to Google Docs if they forget about theNetwork.io. Try to reach out to GSB students to figure out the new URL for the appropriate Google Doc.
