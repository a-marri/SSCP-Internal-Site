# SSCP - VPUE Grant Funding

# VPUE Grant Funding

## Notes from 2012_10_12 meeting with Chris Gerdes

[](#h.jbcfhxmqa9hv)

I met with Gerdes this morning. He was happy to be our advisor and he offered the following advice.

* I should double check with Brian Thomas again to confirm that asking for a VPUE Departmental Grant is our best option. We could also request funding through the ME department or through the School of Engineering's SURF program.If we ever email Gerdes about stuff we should CC Brad Osgood.Make sure we leave out discussions of our group's flaws. We should be relentlessly positive in the proposal.We should go though the VPUE office's guidelines and make sure we focus on addressing their goals.Mention that while we are independent Gerdes is providing mentorship and our work fits in perfectly with his interests. We are developing innovative automotive technologies, we are pushing the boundaries, and we are doing things independently.We should say that we will meet with Gerdes, but the meetings don't have to be formal. Meet every other week.Discuss the strong internal leadership structure of the group.Our particular requests regarding timing and the volume of funding is trickier.We have to think about California labor laws.Once we start paying students we can't necessarily ask them to volunteer beyond the 10 hours that they are paid per week (during the school year).How do we justify why some students are paid while others are not paid for the same type of work?We could create two buckets: students that are doing leadership roles vs. students that are doing manufacturing.We could ask for funding for our time in Australia.It may be a little bit tricky since students wouldn't be enrolled, but they would be doing field work.The VPUE's office may not actually want students taking time off in the spring.Gerdes said he couldn't think of any precedent of the VPUE encouraging students talking a leave of absence from school while receiving funding.Full stipends for students taking a leave of absence may be off the table.However we can ask for 10 hrs per week. Gerdes was initially unconvinced at first that we could justify spring quarter funding. I said that there are in fact students who need additional financial support during the school year. We have people who are taking TAships, and we have people working part time at Google etc.Talking about safety and the fact that VPUE funding would allow us to build the car during normal working hours instead of 8pm-5am every day would be good.Since there is a chance that people may object to fall quarter or spring quarter funding we should delineate the request into clearly separated sections. Then they could reject fall quarter funding without rejecting summer quarter funding.It is always possible to expand the size of funding once the proposal has been approved.Start with requesting funding for ten or less. Less would be better.

* We would have everyone apply for funding through the SoEThere was some discussion about having us apply through multiple professors: one professor for each department. Brad would have been the person to figure out what department administers the fundingBut Gerdes will be able to sponsor everyoneWe can submit a proposal to Brad directly and then the School of Engineering will administer the fundingIf we tried to get outside grants those would require a PI. The university needs there to be a PI to control what grants the school applies to. Outside grants would be challenging for us to do. Gerdes wasn't thrilled about being our PI or having us find another PI for an outside grantsUpdate the proposal to say that we will comply with SoE general procedure for stipends. we will make presentations as per the ME final poster sessionmake the proposal shortThe timeline is unknown at the moment. Chris and the solar car team lead will decide who receives funding
