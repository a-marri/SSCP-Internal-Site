## History of SSCP Cars

Welcome to the illustrious Stanford Solar Fail Team. We've been snatching defeat from the jaws of victory since 1989.

AfterBurner, SunBurner, and Back2Back Burner

These cars were built during the 1990s. They all have names that end in "Burner", and they all caught fire. We've gotten better at building battery packs since then. Apparantly, all young solar car teams do this. Exhibit A: Sikat II and Umicar Imagine.

### Solstice

This car was a glimmer of hope, a simple design executed by a pragmatic team and then thoroughly tested. It actually won the stock class of NASC 2005, if only because CalSol's car broke down five miles before the finish line (news article). Sadly, the team failed to take it to Australia, so we'll never know how it would have done.

### Equinox

This car was beautiful, and almost fast. It had a powerful array, a nice aero design, nice tires, and was fairly light.

But no. This car suffered a serious lack of testing. The array was attached less than two weeks before the race. The electrical system was missing some critical hardware filtering, and some important measurements were pure noise. So on Day One, Nuna got to witness the spectacle of their old $200,000 Nuna2 Gocherman array, attached to a Stanford car by means of blue masking tape and traveling 20 clicks slower than Nuna2 did. Unbeknownst to the team, the array was also not plugged in. The bus current reading was too messy to tell.

Just south of Alice Springs, Equinox blew a tire, spun out, managed to hit the only concrete berm within a thousand miles, and skidded upside down into a fire ant colony. This revealed a bright spot in Equinox's design: the rollcage was sound.

### Apogee

Apogee was also beautiful, and also almost fast. The mech and electrical systems were generally sound. It had a somewhat flawed aero concept (too much topshell curvature, and terrible separated flow behind the bubble). Sadly, the MPPTs on Apogee produced a fraction of their design power. At solar noon, we were getting 800W when we should have been getting 1100+. In addition, the tires were not aligned properly during the race (a mistake which Stanford has been making since the early 90's) which greatly added the the rolling resistance.

Meanwhile, Tokai was going the speed limit throughout all of South Australia, producing 1800 watts like a boss. Apogee attained a dubious distinction: we were the slowest car to cross the outback without having to trailer.

### Xenith

Xenith was our most beautiful, most ambitious, and almost-fastest car yet. It had a fairly extreme aero concept: 0.6 square meters of frontal area, a ludicrously low figure, significantly less than any other car in the race. We have yet to get Xenith into a windtunnel; we suspect it might perform very well. On the Stuart Highway, it did not. We suspect we had significant drag from the way the bladelike aerobody jittered around on an extremely stiff suspension.

The thin aerobody caused us to make compromises on the suspension, which shouldn't be done again. The space for the front suspension was limited, so we crammed in a short-travel suspension, which had less than 2 inches of travel, compared to 3 inches for Apogee and 4-5 inches of critically damped suspension for the other top competitors. For Apogee, the aerobody was built around the chosen mechanical systems, whereas in this case we built the mechanical systems inside the aerobody.

Rear wheel steering seemed like a good idea, but the only other time it has been done in the past 10 years was by the 2003 Michigan car that failed to qualify for ASC. This actually turned out very well, but it is unclear that the real-world results align with the analysis that lead us to take the weight penalty for the "sailing" sytem. In short, we took almost as much risk with sailing and a crazy aerobody as Umicore took with their concentrators, and with similar results.

Our secret weapon were our wheel "skirts". Like rear wheel electrically actuated steering, this had never been done before. It turns out that ground effects cause downforce. Anybody who watches NASCAR and drinks beer could have told us that.

On Day One, Nuna got to witness the spectacle of us traveling 90 kph for two hours, then 0kph for two hours while we huddled by the side of the road with Dremel and a blowtorch and some solder, trying to fix the stator which we had completely fucked. Our tires also bubbled like chewing gum, thereby expanding and running into various suspension parts.

Days two through five went a bit better, though our power consumption was still very undecent. On day six, we got amazingly little power; "overcast" turned out to be "thunderclouds" and our array was producing less than 200 watts. There was no day seven, since we gave up and drove to Adelaide.

While all of the best teams panicked when they realized we would all be using the same SunPower cells and put their cars on serious diets, we made a car that was just as heavy as our 2009 vehicle, which wasn't very light to start with. The game turned out to be rolling resistance, not aerodynamics, as we were riding on worse tires than we had ever (not) used before.

Xenith attained an even more dubious distinction: we traveled almost as far as Apogee without having to trailer.

What we did well: We built a bitchin' car.  We tried some crazy stuff technically, like our array, rear wheel steering, and the cut 'n' glue chassis panels.  Our problem was with follow-through.

### Luminos

Luminos was built for reliability. It was a very robust and dependable car, but also decently fast. Luminos used custom motors and wheels, perhaps the best suspension system we've made, a custom Woodward rack, the best SunPower cells available commercially or in research, and other key innovations.

During the race, Luminos had no significant driving-related break-downs,&#x20;
