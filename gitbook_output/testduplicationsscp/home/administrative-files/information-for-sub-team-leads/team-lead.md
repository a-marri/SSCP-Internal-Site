Over the past two years I've been collecting ideas that shaped the way I tried to lead the team. Some of them worked beautifully. Some of them I never fully executed. Some may have only offered moderate gain. Still, I thought I'd share them with you, and you can interpret these however you see fit.

Motivation

* Remember that losing the race is not fun. No volume of partying in Adelaide, backpacking in New Zealand, or lounging in the Bay of Thailand can wipe away the sour memories of a shitty raceHow is building a successful car not cool enough? Why is building a shiny car that breaks down cooler?What is more rewarding: to build a successful project/company or a project/company with a lot of hype but that fails when it mattersAnything on Xenith that can work in the current car should be stolen or duplicated without a brand new design. The more stuff we take from Xenith or Apogee the more likely we can do lolz projects next summer. Plus the car will be well tested.With a startup you have to define company values early on before you have a dozen employeesRealize that we are a resource poor team. We are not MichiganUse short term milestones to keep members on track. Doing things at the last minute hurts the team. No beast modeCheck out this powerpoint. Many aspects are highly relevant for solar car, some sections aren't relevant for a volunteer student group. http://www.slideshare.net/reed2001/culture-1798664Harvard Business ReviewHarvard Business School has some really great content for managing teams that I'd encourage you to look into.At minimum, I'd recommend signing up for their free Management Tip of the Day emails: https://email.hbr.org/preference-center. Almost all of the tips have been really useful for leading Solar Car.You can also sign up for their other daily emails at the link. The Harvard Business Review magazine is also quite good, but it costs $80-$100 a year for a subscription. The Harvard Business Review does a nice job of summarizing the latest and best peer reviewed research and books on business management and puts everything into magazine form. If you decide to get the magazine subscription I'd recommend signing up through Amazon to get the lowest subscription price.

Development

* Create a top level model of how the solar car works. Sit down with all team leads with their past team leads and greg. Electrical, mechanical, composites, programming, aero, array, code, Find out how their systems work. Look at their requirements. What are the inputs to their system. What are the outputs. What is their timeline. What are their dependencies. What have been points of failure in the past. What needs to be reviewed: design reviews. What are new members working on. What resources do they need in the next three months. What are areas of risk. How can this team cut costs compared to last cycle. What new inventions and innovations are on the market now in your product space compared to two years ago today? What deadlines do you have for yourself in the next quarter?Push for perfectionHave members complete project debriefsIf the race was in two months (should we tell people that we will do the Atacama race or the South Africa Race?) what would we steal from Xenith?Remind people about our hierarchy of needs. Does weight matter: no. Does aero and power consumption matter: yes.
* Push for perfection

Innovation

* Don't allow innovation inbreeding. Bring in new outside ideas. Have members post interesting videos or lectures that they find. Don't embrace hacks. If someone says it is a hack then it is shit and it shouldn't be on the car. If it is a hack because the ambitions are too complex, make it simpler and more elegant. If it is a hack because of a time crunch, then let Wesley and Greg know so that we can allocate more time so that you can produce a respectable solution.The team must continue to innovate yet maintain organizational stability

Yourself

* Don't care about getting credit for yourself. Care about results. 
* Leaders know how to be extroverted when in public although they may or not be introvertedMultitasking doesn't workNot deciding is worse than deciding wrongEstablish your credibility by working hard and being a good role  modelRealize and publicize when we have problems that do not have a viable solution-Make a very detailed list of things that we need and things that we wantAlways being nice and respectful may not be the best for the teamThings you should think about: defect prevention, identifying managing and controlling changes, project closure (project debrief), what are objectives, assessing and controlling risk, estimating and allocating resources, controlling project execution, forecasting future trends of the project, Things to create: a project charter, business case, scope statement, project management plan, work breakdown structure, risk management plan, communications plan, governance model, issue log, action item list, project schedule, stakeholder analysis, document management.

* Things to create: a project charter, business case, scope statement, project management plan, work breakdown structure, risk management plan, communications plan, governance model, issue log, action item list, project schedule, stakeholder analysis, document management.
* Carnegie: Don't criticize, condemn or complain. Give honest and sincere appreciation. Arouse in the person an eager to want. 
* Carnegie: Become genuinely interested in other people. Smile. Remember that a person's name is to that person the sweetest and most important sound in any language. Be a good listener. Encourage others to talk about themselves. Talk in terms of the other person's interests. Make the other person feel important-and do it sincerely.
* Carnegie: The only way to get the best of an argument is to avoid it. Show respect for the other person's opinions. Never say, "You're wrong." If you are wrong, admit it quickly and emphatically. Begin in a friendly way. Get the other person saying "yes, yes" immediately. Let the other person do a great deal of the talking. Let the other person feel that the idea is his or hers. Try honestly to see things from the other person's point of view. Be sympathetic with the other person's ideas and desires. Appeal to the nobler motives. Dramatize your ideas. Throw down a challenge. 
* Carnegie: Be sincere. Know exactly what you want the other person to do. Be empathetic. Ask yourself what it is that the other person wants. Consider the benefits that person will receive from doing what you suggest. Match those benefits to the other person's wants. Put suggestions in the form that will convey to the other person the idea that he personally will benefit. 
* Carnegie: Being a leader: Begin with praise and honest appreciation. Call attention to people's mistakes indirectly. Talk about your own mistakes before critiquing the other people. Ask questions instead of giving direct orders. Let the other person save face. Praise the slightest improvement and praise every improvement. Be "hearty in your approbation and lavish in your praise". Give the other person a fine reputation to live up to. Use encouragement. Make the fault seem easy to correct. Make the other person happy about doing the thing you suggest.

People

* http://www.wimp.com/creativityaffected/If people say they just want to do fun projects then say they are being wasteful and selfishMaintain team visionMake sure new members know how hard older members workYou need think about respect, communication, assertiveness, and optimism Think about hierarchy of needs: physiological and safety may not matter. Social (friendship etc), esteem (self-respect, autonomy, achievement, status, recognition, attention), self-actualization( the drive to become what one is capable of becoming).Task significance, social interaction, knowledge of results, responsibility for resultsHave end of the year awards. Stanford students need rewardStanford students strive for success in the classroom, success in extracurricular, and success in social life. There are time conflicts between these.Have team leads let you know who is good and who needs to be offered additional responsibility on the team. Then it is sub team leads job to keep. Those people. I am going to be really disturbed if I see that people that we want to keep have started leaving your areaYour job is to make people be successfulHave team leads present what they have done the last weekPay attention to when people come in sadDon't assume that everyone is a dedicated to solar car as you areHold people accountable to the goals of their project. If they say it will help us collect data, then they should produce a data report at the end. If they say it will increase efficiency, then they should produce tests that show whether or not there was a statistically significant change. If the change was negative then revert back to the old. Have face to face meetings Missing meetings and missing deadlines is an indication that people aren't unified with overall visionBe willing to fire people from the team or just forget about them if they don't show up any moreTell people if they are not a good fit. Most Stanford students aren't actually fit for solar car, and you aren't doing them any favors by letting them hang on.Tell people they are part of a special group of peopleMake deadlines even harder and make sure people realize that they are letting their teammates downOnly invest in people who will return value to the team. If they can't produce then we will take them off the listPeople want to feel like they are being listened to and that they are making a differenceAvoid applying extreme time constraints. Competitive pressure with coworkers can also be a killer. Instead, use positive pressure in the form of a challenging assignment that's tough but that the team has the skills to solve.Ease people into changeDesign manufacturing work spaces to be open and flexible like McLaren. Open office spaces may hamper individual creativity in the sense that people can't spend time alone to focus on a problem. They need a space they can go to to not be interrupted. Open spaces vs cubicles should be up to the employees. Ask what they prefer. If you have motivated and talented people they should be encouraged to work alone when creativity or efficiency is the highest priority. (Except when online brainstorming)

Have team leads let you know who is good and who needs to be offered additional responsibility on the team. Then it is sub team leads job to keep. Those people. I am going to be really disturbed if I see that people that we want to keep have started leaving your area

Your job is to make people be successful

Have team leads present what they have done the last week

Pay attention to when people come in sad

Don't assume that everyone is a dedicated to solar car as you are

Hold people accountable to the goals of their project. If they say it will help us collect data, then they should produce a data report at the end. If they say it will increase efficiency, then they should produce tests that show whether or not there was a statistically significant change. If the change was negative then revert back to the old. 

Have face to face meetings 

Missing meetings and missing deadlines is an indication that people aren't unified with overall vision

Be willing to fire people from the team or just forget about them if they don't show up any more

Tell people if they are not a good fit. Most Stanford students aren't actually fit for solar car, and you aren't doing them any favors by letting them hang on.

Tell people they are part of a special group of people

Make deadlines even harder and make sure people realize that they are letting their teammates down

Only invest in people who will return value to the team. If they can't produce then we will take them off the list

People want to feel like they are being listened to and that they are making a difference

Avoid applying extreme time constraints. Competitive pressure with coworkers can also be a killer. Instead, use positive pressure in the form of a challenging assignment that's tough but that the team has the skills to solve.

Ease people into change

Design manufacturing work spaces to be open and flexible like McLaren. Open office spaces may hamper individual creativity in the sense that people can't spend time alone to focus on a problem. They need a space they can go to to not be interrupted. Open spaces vs cubicles should be up to the employees. Ask what they prefer. 

If you have motivated and talented people they should be encouraged to work alone when creativity or efficiency is the highest priority. (Except when online brainstorming)

If you have to criticize someone use "and" instead of " you did this, 'but' you didn't do that).
