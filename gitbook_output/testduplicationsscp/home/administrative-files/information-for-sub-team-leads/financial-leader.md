# SSCP - Financial Leader

# Financial Leader

This page may need some editing as it is based on parts of a document that Wesley wrote up for new Cycling Team FOs.

# You're the new treasurer!

[](#h.qerzfzum1mx4)

Awesome. Welcome to the job. You will play a huge role on the team and you'll learn a lot more about every facet of building cars and racing. Below are some details with information about how to jump into your role quickly. 

# SSE Fun

[](#h.48o7hi7w3qpe)

Almost every step that you take as a the team treasurer (or financial officer, or financial manager, or FO, or FM or whatever you want to call it) will involve the SSE. The SSE is Stanford Student Enterprises, a branch of the ASSU. You will deal with the Capital Group (Cap-Group) which is basically Stanford's student run bank for on campus VSOs. You will have to ask someone at the SSE when the next training session is for new treasurers. The SSE training may change from year to year, but generally, you will need to familiarize yourself with Mygroups2 (or OrgSync once that comes online). They will have some sort of online training and an in person training session for you to complete at Old Union. Once you let them know that you will be the new FO, they will get you all the details that you will need. You should also read the FO manual while you are doing your training with the SSE. Here is a link http://mygroups2.stanford.edu/SSEBanking/Forms/2010-11_FO_Manual.pdf. The training sessions should give you a general idea of how to navigate through MyGroups2. The most important functions of MyGroups2 will be the reimbursement and deposit tool, so let's jump into those.

# Reimbursements

[](#h.n5i37pusfp16)

You will process a ton of reimbursements as the team treasurer. Whenever the team needs to make large purchases (bikes, clothing, parts, etc.) some members usually like to make the purchase on a personal credit card so that they can earn points. Once they have made the purchase you will need to reimburse them through the SSE. Also, the team reimburses racers when they go to WCCC races. The team will reimburse a racer's gas, race registration, and hotel expenses, but expenses such as food, vehicle maintenance, bike maintenance, and other incidental expenses are NOT reimbursable. Each weekend during the racing seasons racers will have a collection of expenses that need to be reimbursed. You can ask racers to hold on to their reimbursements until the end of the season (but some people may not be able to afford to wait for a reimbursement) or you can reimburse people periodically throughout the season. Once you have a member that needs a reimbursement ask them to fill out a reimbursement form. The FO before you should be able to give you the latest draft of thie document. This is a word document that cycling team treasurers use to keep track of reimbursements. When you receive a reimbursement packet it will be a large pile of receipts, bank statements, and other stuff. The reimbursement form helps you keep track of all of the paperwork, it allows the member to give you some information (such as their email address and mailing address) that you need for MyGroups, and it allows you and the member to confirm that you agree on how much the reimbursement should be for.

Once you have the reimbursement form and all of their documentation you can submit the reimbursement. The necessary documentation will vary depending on the type of reimbursement. The SSE FO training will teach you what documentation is necessary and the reimbursement form should let racers know what documentaton they need. Generally each expense needs a itemized receipt and a bank statement or copies of a cashed check as documentation. You need a document that proves what was purchased and another document that proves who made the purchase. You will find over time that documentation requirements can be a big headache for you and for racers. SSE policies may fluctuate over time and different sets of documentation will pass or be rejected depending on your luck that day. Just be patient and explain to members why their reimbursements aren't going through. If you see that a reimbursement is marked for review in MyGroups2 that means it will likely be rejected and you should call the SSE to find out why. When you first call they won't know, but if you tell them the reimbursement request number in question and ask them to pull the reimbursement packet from their filing cabinet they can usually tell you why it was rejected. 

I won't go into the details about how to submit a reimbursements because the FO manual will explain the process for you. I will just include a bunch of tips below.

* Submit reimbursements as soon as possible and tell members to expect slow turn around time from the SSE. In the best of times the SSE can have reimbursement checks ready in three to five days but there have been times in the 2011 to 2012 years when reimbursements often took weeks or a month to go through.If there is a reimbursement that needs to be processed urgently you can select priority processing when you submit the request in mygroups. If you are asking for the SSE to have a small check ready the same day they may charge you a $35 fee, but if you are asking them to reimburse someone for a large purchase within 48 hours you can usually ask them to waive the fee. The SSE is often backlogged and slow to work with, but understand that they are understaffed and they have run into problems such as crashed servers and employee turnover problems in the past. Again, be patient and feel free to call the SSE banking associates or the accountants if you need something to be expedited.If someone asks for a gas reimbursement they need to drive at least one other person to the racecourse and back or A LOT of team equipment. Don't reimburse people who are driving themselves and encourage the carpool organizer to use as few cars a possible. Also ask the carpool director to use fuel efficient cars instead of gas guzzlers. The SSE has this policy that you can reimburse people for up to $0.51 per mile. Don't follow this policy. You will spend too much for automotive reimbursements. The team only reimburses members for the gas that they purchase for driving to and back from WCCC races or nationals.When members are asking for a gas reimbursement they should fill their tank before they leave Stanford. They should refill their tank as needed along the way and they should fill up once again when they get back to Stanford. The gas they they burn during the last fill up and the fill ups on the road will represent the gas that they actually used to get to the race. Don't reimburse them for anything more.Some teams don't accept team pay. Make sure that racers know to bring checkbooks before these races. If a team does accept team pay then tell racers not to pay registration fees at the race. You will pay their registration fee for them later. Tell racers to always pay for registration fees with a credit card or a check. Reimbursing stuff with cash is a huge hassle and the team policy has traditionally been to not reimburse racers who pay with cash. Everyone should understand that reimbursement will be easier if they pay online. You could even offer some incentive - like the team will only reimburse one race (crit or RR) if you don't pre-reg online. It's easy, and you should know you're going far enough in advance to just do it. Make sure they save their receipts, and know to submit a CC statement with the reimbursement request.

# Deposits

[](#h.5nb5xpm1pqs8)

Deposits will be explained during the FO training sessions, but here are some notes that are specific to the cycling team.

* Members can submit guest deposits on your behalf. If they go to mygorups2.stanford.edu they can click on the button for guest deposits. If they fill out the form, print the produced ticket, and bring the ticket and money to the SSE they can do everything without you being involved. This is really handy if other officers need to deposit dues checks, clothing checks, or any other checks. Ask the other officers to describe in the description section what the deposit is for especially if it is a deposit combining many types of payment. When you go back through myGroups the only information that you will see is something like "Jonny Appleseed deposited $5,238.28 on October 15th." That isn't really helpful especially if you ever try to do a end of the year budget review. I usually ask members to type a note in the description section saying something like "$2,000 in dues, $200 in bike rental fees, and $3,038.28 in clothing deposits." Then you can figure out what the checks were for. With all deposits, once you make the deposit there is no way for you to see the checks again. This means that it a good idea for you to make an note of checks that you deposit. You should make a note when you do deposits yourself just like when you have other officers do a guest deposit.Any member (not just officers) can do a guest deposit. This can allow members to pay dues without having to find you.Always deposit funds into the #2800 general spending account. If you put money in a different account it will be more difficult to use those funds for reimbursements etc. You can use #2800 funds for almost anything.

# Other stuff

[](#h.md1y4mat3p43)

* Hold office hours. These are useful because they allow members to come in and talk with you in person. You will quickly learn what documentation the SSE needs, but it can be difficult for other members to remember if they only submit a few reimbursements per year. If the members come into go over their documentation with you in person it allows both of you to avoid follow up requests for more documentation.When you receive a team pay invoice from another team go to the wccc-info.com website and make sure that the invoice looks okay. Sometime another treasurer may try to charge you for more racers than you had racing at a race. It is an easy mistake to make since team pay invoices are tricky to deal with. Just send a polite email if you see a discrepancy and ask them to send a new invoice.inflation and the rising cost of biking expenses will increase the team costs over time. Adjust team dues and nationals copay appropriately so that payments follow the real costs of the team.Check the team mailbox periodically. It should be in the Ford center. Talk to Pam.

Reimbursement requests, mail, invoice payments and all sorts of other stuff will end up in that folder periodically. Check it often. It is folder number 7255. Commit that number to memory since 7255 is our ASSU group number. You will need it often. The folder is a convenient place for people to leave stuff for you to pick up if you don't have office hours, but it is not 100% secure.Get admin rights for the team Facebook and Twitter accounts.
