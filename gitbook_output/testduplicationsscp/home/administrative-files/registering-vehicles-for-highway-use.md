### Specially Constructed Vehicles

580\.  A "specially constructed vehicle" is a vehicle which is built for private use, not for resale, and is not constructed by a licensed manufacturer or remanufacturer. A specially constructed vehicle may be built from (1) a kit; (2) new or used, or a combination of new and used, parts; or (3) a vehicle reported for dismantling, as required by Section 5500 or 11520, which, when reconstructed, does not resemble the original make of the vehicle dismantled. A specially constructed vehicle is not a vehicle which has been repaired or restored to its original design by replacing parts.

From: http://www.dmv.ca.gov/vr/spcnsreg.htm December 2012

A "home-made, specially constructed, or kit vehicle" is a vehicle that is built for private use, not for resale, and is not constructed by a licensed manufacturer or remanufacturer. These vehicles may be built from a kit, new or used parts, a combination of new and used parts, or a vehicle reported for dismantling (junked) that, when reconstructed, does not resemble the original make of the vehicle that was dismantled.&#x20;

A specially constructed vehicle (SPCNS) does not include a vehicle that has been repaired or restored to its original design by replacing parts or a vehicle modified from its original design.&#x20;

Example: A Volkswagen "Beetle" with modified fenders, engine compartment lid, and front end, but still recognizable as a Volkswagen is not considered a specially constructed vehicle.&#x20;

NOTE: The registration requirements for kit commercial vehicles are the same as for specially constructed vehicles.&#x20;

### The Registration Requirements are:

* A completed Application for Title or Registration (REG 343).A vehicle verification done by the California Highway Patrol (CHP). You must start your application process with the DMV prior to contacting the CHP for a vehicle verification. DMV verifies trailers with an unladen weight of 6,000 pounds or less.A completed Statement of Construction (REG 5036).Proof of ownership, such as invoices, receipts, manufacturers’ certificates of origin, bills of sale, or junk receipts for the major component parts (engine, frame, transmission, and body). NOTE: A motor vehicle bond is required when proof of ownership cannot be obtained for parts valued a $5,000 or more.Official brake and light adjustment certificates. When an official brake and light station that inspects specific vehicles such as motorcycles and large commercial vehicles is not located within a reasonable distance, DMV will accept a Statement of Facts (REG 256) from a repair shop attesting that the brakes and lights are in proper working order. Brake and light certificates are not required for off-highway vehicles or trailers weighing less than 3,000 pounds gross vehicle weight.A weight certificate for commercial vehicles weighing 10,000 pounds or less.An emission control inspection (smog check) by a Bureau of Automotive Repair (BAR) Referee Station.

### Not needing to be the first 500

From CalSol:

You don't need to worry about being one of the first 500. Here's the information that we dug up in brief:

"As for lining up to be one of the first 500, that's not actually necessary. The 500 are for emissions waivers—which electric cars don't need. Every year, by California law, 500 specially constructed vehicles are permitted to use their nominal year of manufacture as the date for determining their emissions requirements. If you use a piece of (for example) a 1969 Volkswagen as the basis for a modified specially constructed vehicle (even if it's just an engine mount or something), if you're one of the 500, you can register it as belonging to the 1969 model year, and avoid emissions tests. Otherwise #501 and up register as a 2012 (or whatever year it currently is), and must meet that year of manufacture's emissions requirements."

The result being that we must meet all the emission requirements of a 2012 vehicle. However, as solar cars don't have emissions, that is of no consequence. When we're ready we'll just fill out the necessary paperwork and register Zephyr as a 2012 model year vehicle.

### Getting a Temporary Registration

From CalSol:

I don't remember the details, but at one point we needed to ask for a "partial" registration. This was important because we didn't have all the pieces that the person at the counter wanted. I'm not sure if this is routine but it helped us substantially. This was one trip to the DMV, no car needed.

After getting a temporary registration we had to get a brake and light inspecting. We looked up places that were certified to do this and drove Impulse (using the temporary registration) to the shop. This took a few hours. After that we returned to the DMV with both the temporary registration and the brake and lamp inspection paperwork. This took a second trip to the DMV. I think that was the last thing we needed. I forget how insurance war taken care of.
