# SSCP - Internal Review and Reckoning

# Internal Review and Reckoning

10/20/14 - Special Meeting (Monday, 6 PM)

Present: Max, Darren, Anna, Guillermo, Aravind, Jamie, 

Premise: Aero priority has produced several mechanical issues. 

1. Suspension mounting and high suspension loads. A-arm angles are too big, mounting may require complex chassis panel-fillet attachment, loads in A-arms are too large. Too many unknowns with leaving these suspension loads unaddressed. Aravind's Shark analysis has showed that loads are twice as large as those in Luminos' suspension. 
2. Too many unknowns with leaving these suspension loads unaddressed. Aravind's Shark analysis has showed that loads are twice as large as those in Luminos' suspension. 
3. Chassis mounting issues in general. Where to mount roll cage? Roll cage cannot currently be mounted with its bolts entirely in shear. 
4. Roll cage still intersects bubble. 
5. Driver leg space is very restricted and likely does not currently fit brake/accelerator pedals.

Roll cage still intersects bubble. 

Driver leg space is very restricted and likely does not currently fit brake/accelerator pedals. 

Notes

* Notes 
* We want thin nomex core in every part of the car shell, and thick nomex core in the structural parts.

Driver Fit Conversations

Does it fit? Rachel fits. Tallest person we know can drive is Anna. Wouldn't pass head sweep with tall person.

Rachel eye measurement: 75 cm from bottom of Nathan’s jig, plus height off ground, plus core thickness

Pedal configurations. Just one pedal for brake, with one paddle for accelerator. NHS recommends a potted or sprung design, not just a button.

Location of steering Wheel

For first draft: 63cm from back panel for steering wheel location, based on Rachel’s measurements?

For Logan: 68cm from back panel of driver compartment. 

Action Items

* Create Sunwhale-30 model with suspension hard-points moved inward to reduce loads on suspension members and chassis panels. Measure aerodynamic penalty of making suspension fit, then weight other options.
