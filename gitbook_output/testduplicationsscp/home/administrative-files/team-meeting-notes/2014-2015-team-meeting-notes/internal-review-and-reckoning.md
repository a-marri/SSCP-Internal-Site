## Internal Review and Reckoning

10/20/14 - Special Meeting (Monday, 6 PM)

Present: Max, Darren, Anna, Guillermo, Aravind, Jamie,&#x20;

Premise: Aero priority has produced several mechanical issues.&#x20;

1. Suspension mounting and high suspension loads. A-arm angles are too big, mounting may require complex chassis panel-fillet attachment, loads in A-arms are too large. Too many unknowns with leaving these suspension loads unaddressed. Aravind's Shark analysis has showed that loads are twice as large as those in Luminos' suspension.&#x20;
2. Too many unknowns with leaving these suspension loads unaddressed. Aravind's Shark analysis has showed that loads are twice as large as those in Luminos' suspension.&#x20;
3. Chassis mounting issues in general. Where to mount roll cage? Roll cage cannot currently be mounted with its bolts entirely in shear.&#x20;
4. Roll cage still intersects bubble.&#x20;
5. Driver leg space is very restricted and likely does not currently fit brake/accelerator pedals.&#x20;

Notes

* Notes&#x20;
* We want thin nomex core in every part of the car shell, and thick nomex core in the structural parts.&#x20;

Driver Fit Conversations

Does it fit? Rachel fits. Tallest person we know can drive is Anna. Wouldn't pass head sweep with tall person.

Rachel eye measurement: 75 cm from bottom of Nathan’s jig, plus height off ground, plus core thickness

Pedal configurations. Just one pedal for brake, with one paddle for accelerator. NHS recommends a potted or sprung design, not just a button.

Location of steering Wheel

For first draft: 63cm from back panel for steering wheel location, based on Rachel’s measurements?

For Logan: 68cm from back panel of driver compartment.&#x20;

Action Items

* Create Sunwhale-30 model with suspension hard-points moved inward to reduce loads on suspension members and chassis panels. Measure aerodynamic penalty of making suspension fit, then weight other options.&#x20;
