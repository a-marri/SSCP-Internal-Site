Safety Info Dump

To: Guillermo Gomez <ggomez2@stanford.edu>

Here is a big list of the safety enhancing ideas I've thought of so far.

Driver wears a HANS device. See here for place to purchase. This device keeps the head from moving relative to the body in a crash. It must match the helmet and driver, but there are only two sizes.

[place to purchase](http://simpsonraceproducts.com/hans/hans-device-pro-ultra-lite/)

Driver wears full coverage helmet with built in microphone, visor, and air port. Attach air port of helmet directly to NACA duct through bubble if current cooling is less than ideal. The helmet needs special lugs to mate to the HANS device. Simpson also makes helmets with radio options, including ones with reflective coatings. Simpson is the safety equipment sponsor of NASCAR and has a location in NC. They evaluate sponsorship opportunities for the following year in October.

Collapsible steering column. This is a COTS item.

Determine optimal steering wheel location instead of wherever is convenient. Better positioning might reduce fatigue and make the display more visible.

A real seat. Current driver compartment concentrates impact forces on a few torso contact points. Seat also increases driver comfort

Adjustable pedals. Tall drivers shouldn't be bunched up; short drivers should be able to reach.

Battery pack is in the driver compartment. It's a fire hazard! Move it elsewhere in the vehicle (lower would also lower CG). Enclose in a puncture resistant and fire resistant container.

NASCAR has a fire suppression system that will fill the car with an extinguishing agent if the driver pulls a lever. Novec 1230 from 3M looks like the latest and greatest agent, and Fire-Trak sells NASCAR suppression systems. Could have similar system for entire car, or could be limited to battery pack only.

[Fire-Trak](http://www.fire-trak.com/)

Driver wears fire resistant garments - anywhere from Nomex underwear to full fire-suit (with sponsor patches!)

Roof flaps combat flipping due to lift from spinning car.

Emergency brake should be accessible without leaning forward.

Hatch release mechanism must be improved. Use actual handles, not rope. Bystander with no knowledge of car should be able to open it. Driver should be able to open hatch easily, without contorting, and with either hand.

Emergency personnel should be able to cut off roof using jaws of life, even if car is damaged in crash and hatch is jammed shut. Not sure how to accomplish this - perhaps mount bubble using well-marked hard points?

Consider survival cell construction for driver compartment. In particular, I think intrusion protection is lacking in the current design. Broken carbon, suspension parts, etc. could penetrate the honeycomb and injure the driver.

Some F1 survival cells give extra volume around the elbows for more range of motion and comfort.

For crash testing, I could envision a collaboration of solar car teams, auto manufacturers, and race teams funding/providing engineering work for a super-lightweight composite vehicle crash test program. If we have the resources, we could outsource the whole thing to someone like IMMI/CAPE. Also, Michigan and their domestic auto manufacturer sponsors have many more resources available for this type of testing.

I we do a crash test program ourselves, I think starting with things near the driver and working outward makes sense.

Is Google Glass suitable for a HUD? If we're buying a new helmet, Helmet Mounted Display (HMD) is a keyword to investigate.

A little HMI thing: turn signal and headlight buttons should be latching switches.

Last, and perhaps most importantly, have a safety design review with a professional racing team. We could have one with a NASCAR team, and then actually visit when we go to Aerodyn.

I talked to Harry a little bit about this today, and I understand why things, particularly with respect to the body and battery pack, are the way they are.

What do you mean?

The battery pack enclosure currently includes a chemical barrier layer and fire protection layer. It was intended to go outside the driver compartment in Luminos, but changes had to happen last minute. The odds of a random battery cell failure and fire are astonishingly small.

The honeycomb structures are laminated carbon fiber and aluminum honeycomb. They give plenty of puncture resistance and much strength.

I also saw pictures of the car under construction, and I understand the internal layout better (there's more in there than I thought). Luminos is much more robustly built than other solar cars.

Luminos' driver egress times were well below average.

There are only two FEA analyses on the internal site right now: one for the roll bar and one for the seat belt mounts. Apparently there are more out there somewhere, but they are not posted.

It is gospel that a solar car driver will be killed/seriously injured and the vehicle destroyed in any head-on collision with another vehicle. The only things worth doing are: 1 - practicing as a convoy such that the solar car is never in such a situation 2 - designing a car capable of protecting the driver in case of single-vehicle accidents (eg the solar car flipping on its own).

Here's the read I get on the team thinking as a result of the conversation: "We know Luminos can handle any single-vehicle incident, and any design derived from it can too. We don't need to worry about it much because it's already baked into how we do things."

I see. This was my understanding as well. I do think, however, that you made some good suggestions that we can incorporate into our next design. Hans device maybe.

I'm not sure this understanding is actually backed by data, but I also wouldn't know even if it was. The lack of analysis on the internal site still bothers me though.

To condense this down to a reasonable list:

HANS device. This decreases risk for a specific type of injury with almost no downside. You can even use an open-face helmet with it.

Crash testing. On the email thread Wesley started, there seemed to be interest. As leader, you have a lot of power to set priorities. I don't have the judgement to make this call. I can say, though, that this would take some serious, long-term investment, and it won't get done if we only do it half way.

Design review. This is never a bad idea.

Real seat. Seems like it would have been obvious in the past. Ask mechanical team why it wasn't included in Luminos.

Adjustable pedals. May not be so easy. Mechanical team can evaluate.

Collapsible steering column. May not be so easy. Work was started on this last cycle. Mechanical team can evaluate.

Emergency brake / Hatch release position. Easy if it is designed in early.

Switches. Easy fix for electrical team. Do it.
