# History of SSCP Races

## WSC 2015

[](#h.rj6h54d0bcwr)

Team has set a 16% average speed improvement. It is very ambitious but we think it is a good goal. 

## WSC 2013

[](#h.el2ebfbxj05l)

4th place and top American team. Beat Michigan. Nuon, Tokai, and Twente beat us. Best undergraduate team in the world. 

## WSC 2011

[](#h.qqwgha7g7vil)

11th

## ASC 2010

[](#h.bnq4p5jrcpw)

4th place overall

Inadequate strategy and operational awareness (telemetry was not functional on day 1) led to poor decision making. Race where all top teams drive the speed limit at all times offered no opportunity to catch up.

## WSC 2009

[](#h.ke3w8a5i5mul)

10th place overall, 4th place silicon. Car had no major reliability issues, but lack of understanding of vehicle losses led to high power consumption and a slow race.

## WSC 2007

[](#h.4hxklbmyy5de)

Flipped the car over, masking a lot of other failures. The car was woefully unprepared for the race.

## ASC 2005

[](#h.uognnxfoys8v)

1st place in stock class, was behind most of open class. Car had reliability issues (array went down on last day, car wouldn't start on first day). Chase crashed in to solar car due to lack of convoying practice.

## Sunrayce 95

[](#h.hppk5ab8i103)

The Afterburner started the race slowly, plagued with solar-array maximum- 

power-point-tracker problems. However, once a Stanford solar-car team 

alumnus was called in to make a few adjustments, the Afterburner’s array 

came to life and propelled Stanford to consistent top-5 finishes on the last 4 

days of the race. A strong fourth-place showing on the final grueling day 

raised Stanford‘s overall position three places to an excellent fifth-place fin- 

ish. Also, the Stanford team had excellent leadership qualities as evidenced 

by team captain Kate Von Reis. At the victory banquet, Von Reis was pre- 

sented the “Stars of Sunrayce” award for the female who best exemplified 

the spirit of Sunrayce.
