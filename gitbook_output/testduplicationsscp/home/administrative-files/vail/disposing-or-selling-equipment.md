## Disposing or Selling Equipment

It is generally a good idea to touch base with the VAIL building manager, Eddy Morales, if you have concerns about disposing large items. If the items are considered capital equipment by the university then you may have to get Eddy to fill out some property disposal forms.&#x20;

The best time to dispose molds is during the Fall and Spring Campus Clean Up Events. The fall event is usually around October and the spring event is usually in March. Traditionally Stanford PSSI will have dumpsters available for disposing assets and you can request up to $500 in complimentary property disposal assistance from Event Services.

Check the BGM.stanford.edu website for more info.

If you have smaller equipment to dispose, sell, or give away you can contact Stan Dunn standunn@stanford.edu in the Property Management Office. Stan can help you with things like selling solar panels abroad, donating used equipment to other teams, and disposing medium sized things like cabinets. The Stanford Property Management Office will take a cut of the final sale value 1-3% percent, but Stan is actually really helpful. He will manage any ITAR, export, or tax issues. He will even play the "bad guy" if you need a tough negotiator for settling a sale price with a buyer. Make sure you engage Stan before you start  trying to sell assets to get his advice. Stan is really good.
