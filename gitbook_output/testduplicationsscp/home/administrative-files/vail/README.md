## VAIL

There is a 3D model of VAIL that someone (probably Brian in the SoE) built. I put it on the FTP server under /home/sscpftp/VAIL Architecture. It is a Google Sketchup model.&#x20;

According to Brian Carilli, the roof of the kitchen in VAIL was specifically designed to be a storage place for our composite panels. Nothing else can go there since it would be too heavy otherwise. Sven once complained about being able to see panels from the ground level. Adele should be aware of the original intent to store composite panels above the kitchen.

If you ever need touchup paint to fix one of the walls at VAIL Adele hides a few cans of VAIL colored paint on top of the kitchen area on the false roof.&#x20;
