The phones at VAIL are capable of having 5 additional participants on a conference call (max 6 counting yourself).  If you require additional participants you might want to sign up for a number via something like Freeconferencecall.com.

Here's how to connect a conference call:

1. Place the first call and wait for it to be answered.

2\.  Press the MORE softkey (will show on phone display), then press the CONFRN softkey.  This selects a new line and places the first call on hold.

3. Dial another telephone number
4. When the next call is answered, press the CONFRN softkey to add this person to the conference call.  You should now be able to speak to both parties.  Repeat step 2 to add more callers.
