Maintaining the Haas CNC Machine

The team and any other party that uses the CNC machine must collect excess aluminum scrap and store it in plastic containers. If the machine needs its coolant emptied or refilled, this must be done, too. Use five-gallon EH&S containers and file a hazardous material pickup.Â 

Recycling Aluminum Scraps

The number to schedule PSSI is 650-321-4236. The AIF's building number is 14-590. We have an open work order so they will pick-up the aluminum recycling whenever we call.
