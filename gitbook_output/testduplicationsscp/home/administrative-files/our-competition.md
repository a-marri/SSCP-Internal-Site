## Michigan

[](#h.a456yfq0j9o0)

These guys are tools, but nevertheless quite good at building solar cars.

Things they did not so well

* Used flimsy mountain bike brakes in WSC2007, crashedUsed slow rear wheel steering actuator in ASC2003, didn't pass scrutineeringBuilt flimsy front fairing covers for WSC2011, which blew off in a 50kph sidewind and punched a hole in the bubbleArray quality is not as good as Tokai's

## Nuna

[](#h.32ey6px4hq3t)

These guys are generally awesome. They spend less cash than Michigan, get a ton of in-kind sponsorship from just about every big company in the Netherlands, and they build excellent solar cars.

Things they do well

* Aero. Nuna6 is probably the most aerodynamic land vehicle ever built, by a margin, even better than Michigan and Tokai.Publicity. Their website is sweet, their Flickr is sweet, and the coolest videos from WSC2011 are Nuna's.Sponsorship. They tweak their aero in the biggest wind tunnel in Europe, which costs $0 for them and 50000 EUR a day for normal people.Mech design. It's simple, it doesn't fail, and their car weighs 140kg.Organization. Their cars are always done way in advance and have tons of test miles.Backups. For WSC2009, they totaled a car two weeks before the race and built a new one in that time.Techno

Things they do not so well

* Arrays. They got second place in 2009 and 2011 because Tokai was producing significantly more power due to dicing their cells 3x.

## Tokai

[](#h.ve6om7eft985)

These guys serve as a reminder of why America lost most of its manufacturing leadership. The Chinese are cheaper than us and the Japanese are a lot better than us.

Tokai is Japanese. They have minimal internet presence, and they don't chill with the other teams in Darwin. They simply show up for scrutineering with a jesuslike car, win the race, and go home.

Things they do well

* Mech design. Like Nuna: it's simple, it doesn't fail, and their car weighs 140kg.Composites. Their composites are amazing. Their body panels appear to be coreless. Chassis is made by Dome Carbon Magic, a Japanese company that also does parts for Formula 1. Judging by some small imperfections / crushed core, I think that the aerobody was done by students.OrganizationStrategyAero. Nuna claims Tokai's aero is slightly worse, but it clearly worked well enough. Also, Tokai cheats a bit--they have a minimal rollcage made of CF instead of metal. Their bubble is significantly smaller than Nuna's or Michigans.Array. Their array is gorgeous. Unlike other top teams, they have no bubble shading. They were running 17 channels of diced Sanyo HIT cells on custom MPPTS. They probably produced more power than any other team at WSC2011. They definitely did not produce more power than any other team at WSC2009; when Michigan's power was extrapolated at ASC2010 from the IV curves taken during scrutineering it was also 1800W. ([ http://www.ei.u-tokai.ac.jp/kimura/kimura-lab/library/jses2010.pdf WSC2009 paper]).
