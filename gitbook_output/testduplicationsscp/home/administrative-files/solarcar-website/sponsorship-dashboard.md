## Sponsorship Dashboard

As of January 2014 DC's sponsorship dashboard has not been integrated with the new website theme

DC made a nice way to add sponsors to the website. The URL of the dashboard is. http://solarcar.stanford.edu/sponsordashboard To login you need a wordpress account.&#x20;

From DC's email:

Whenever you get sponsorship, add it here, please. It ties in to the sponsor page and other parts of our website.

Please also make sure that you also add the sponsors to our sponsorship list google doc (link valid for 2012-2013). Notice that the first page is for proposed sponsors and the second page is for finalized sponsors.The third page is for companies that we should contact in the 2014-2015 cycle (e.g. they are interested in sponsoring us, but don't have the budget this year).
