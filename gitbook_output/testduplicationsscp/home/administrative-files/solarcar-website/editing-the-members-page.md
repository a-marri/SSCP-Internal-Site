# Editing the Members Page

I usually just edit the HTML directly. I've never been able to edit anything besides the text and pictures using the visual web editor.

Click on the "Text" tab while editing the wordpress page

This will let you edit the HTML directly.

Basically if you want to add a row you will want to copy all of the text between <tr> and </tr>. and paste it back in to the HTML text.

For example if this is the original:

<tr>

A bunch of HTML text that you can ignore

</tr>

and you duplicate that text

<tr>

A bunch of HTML text that you can ignore

</tr>

<tr>

A bunch of HTML text that you can ignore

</tr>

You'll end up with an additional row. However, the picture and text will be a duplicate of the original person's picture and text. You can edit the picture and text when you go back to the Visual web page editor.

You can also delete the text between (and including) <tr> and </tr> to delete a row.
