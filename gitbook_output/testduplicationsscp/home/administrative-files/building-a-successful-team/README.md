[New Roles](/home/administrative-files/new-team-roles)

Some teams like the aero and business teams could use more members to build an actual sub-team. We should make sure that we have an organizational structure that doesn't place too much responsibility or pressure on the team leader. We might not always have a baller team lead like Nathan. Creating separate Engineering Lead, Business Lead, and Race Crew Lead roles might allow each director to focus on a core set of responsibilities without being distracted by other matters. There are also roles that need to have one person devoted to that responsibility. Some of these roles have been covered by other members of the team in their spare time. However, if someone is explicitly assigned to these roles we can give new members a sense of purpose and we can better ensure that these jobs are thoroughly completed.

## Race Crew

[Race Crew](/home/administrative-files/building-a-successful-team/race-crew)

In the 2011 cycle there was not a lot of pre-organized training or any sort of checklists for the members who were on the race crew. In the future there should be assigned race crew managers who are responsible for defining every aspect of what needs to be prepared and executed for WSC. That race crew manager should assign specific duties to members who will be on the race crew (probably in the form of detailed checklists) with the help of past racers and the current race crew. We should dedicate the summer before WSC to training the race crew and running through all contingencies. We'll be able to swap tires blindfolded...

## Logistics

In the future it may help if the engineering lead doesn't have to be distracted with coordinating logistics for the team

## Recruiting

Details: Unassigned Jobs for New Members

We need to give people interesting projects right away so they can see how cool solar car is. Split them up into teams, then show them everything that has been done so far on the design (in CAD, a schematic, ect), then ask them what they want to work on. We need to recruit some critical members, for example to do aero work. A lot of members join the team but eventually drift away because they don't feel like they have a commitment to a project. It would be beneficial if we kept a roster of members and identified members who haven't been around to the shop in a while. If we can send out an email to them to ask if they want to start on a particular project they might come back to the team. A lot of projects are assigned to members of the team on a one-on-one basis between a group lead and whatever members are "in the loop." Whenever there is a project that is approachable for members of any skill level, we should post an announcement to the list so that new members can get an idea of what projects are available even if they aren't waiting around at the shop.
