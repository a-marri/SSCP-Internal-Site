# Challenges

* All members are full time students at Stanford during the year, and work full time during the summer, and designing and constructing the solarcar requires at least 10 people to work another 20-50hrs per week for over a year in addition to their other commitments.
* The total budget for the project over a two year build cycle for a competitive car is over a half million dollars. Raising that kind of money is very difficult even for a team in the Silicon Valley.
* Because we are totally run by undergraduates transferring knowlege between teams is difficult. Most people, building any given car have not designed or built a solarcar before and so it is easy for them to make 'system level' trade-off mistakes. Most of the best teams have an involved faculty adviser that has been doing solarcar racing for decades that makes this less of an issue.
* Accurately simulating the range of conditions (weather and road) a car will undergo during a race across the entire continent of Australia is almost impossible in the US, so race there always a few problems that never manifested during testing in the US.
* Our team has few members who are dedicated to the business side of solar car racing: logistics, fundraising, media, promoting the project, working with the university departments and administrators, etc. We should build a collection of members who are focused on non-engineering projects so that the engineering project leads aren't distracted and so that we can have a group of members who have experience and skills leading a business. Teams like Michigan have a strong business.
* Remember it is always really easy to fail.
