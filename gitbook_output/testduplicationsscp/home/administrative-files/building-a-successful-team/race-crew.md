# Race Crew

Mock race. "The team should take a full week whenever the car is done (several months before the race so changes can be made to the car). I don't want us to go all michigan on this, but the crew should each have specific responsibilities and learn to work together."

"Have a separate "race leader" and "technical leader" that are in constant communication, with very defined responsibilities."
