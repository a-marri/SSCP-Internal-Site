* There is no need for the amount of pain that we have. We have resources that can help and review. Take advantage of consulting from professors and SSCP alumniIt's not that much less educational to learn from someone's mistakes than to learn from your own mistakes.Spend as much time reviewing as you spend designing.We should start freezing boards on the car during the summer. The summer is the time to test.

* Communal design reviews so that things work well togetherHave design review by some professorsReview sessions should be four or five hours long.Have someone to do code review before writing starts, during, and after. What do we want to do? What way should we do this? Someone should write and test, someone should go and test code.Have someone like Sasha, John Shen (good design does he have experience in design reviews), Brian Ignot (a good reviewer), Vivian an alum, or a professional etc. be the final reviewer of board designs before we make a revisionSay that you have to have a schematic review before you do layout.Set up meetings beforehand, go to their house, and bring boba. It will make it worthwhile for you to not have pain and suffering later
