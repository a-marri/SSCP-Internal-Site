# SSCP - Fundraising

# Fundraising

* Recruit more non engineers to do fundraising and business stuff
* Be more like a business like Michigan
* Ask the university for help fundraising
* Ask to set up a new system for fundraising
* Figure out how the Friends of the Daily works and see if SSCP can get a parallel 501(c)(3) foundation
* Figure out how BASES raises so much money
* Auto sports are having a hard time reaching young people. We should try to reach out to auto sports companies offering them the opportunity to connect with a university student audience
