# Notes on staying enrolled after graduation

This is for any undergrads who want to walk through the graduation ceremony at the start of the summer while remaining registered as an enrolled student over the summer. Hopefully this will allow you to remain eligible for the SoE stipends.

Visit this link to review the status requirements. Ensuring that you don't screw up graduation is important, so make sure you confirm all of your plans with your advisor, the Stanford Student Services Center/Registrar, and your department. I don't want any misinformation here to cause problems later down the road.

Here is what I planned to do as of five minutes ago (before I found out that the SoE is only offering our stipends to engineering majors. sadface)

* I would submit a leave of absence in order to take the spring quarter off.I would apply to walk through graduation without conferring my degree.I would apply for the Graduation Quarter Special Registration Status before June 24th.I would walk through graduation at the start of the summer.I would be listed in Axess as enrolled for the summer quarter.I would apply to graduate in Axess before August 2nd.Stanford would confer my degree around September 26th.I would receive my paper diploma around December when Stanford batch processes diplomas.
