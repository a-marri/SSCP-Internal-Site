## Notes on August 21, 2012 Board Meeting

Here is a recap of the action items from today's meeting. Please let me know if I missed anything.

&#x20;

* KUKA: No action items. Our team will work with D2 in San Jose instead of KUKA.VW: I will follow up with my contact at VW. If it seems like I can't negotiate changes without harming our team's relationship with VW I will escalate the negotiations to Chris and/or Todd who can talk directly to Peter Oel, the VW ERL Director. Once our team has finalized our vehicle design we will try to determine the real estate of logos for each sponsorship tier. (However, I realized after the meeting that if we add additional sponsors later in our cycle we risk over-constraining our logo placement.)Oven Building Proposal:

Oven Building Proposal:

* I will follow up with Merry to review the oven design proposal and to have the Stanford Fire Marshall inspect the final oven. The team has a sponsor for lumber lined up for the oven so we will attempt to make some components of the oven during the summer before we complete the final oven in the winter. We will store any components that we prefabricate in our trailer.
