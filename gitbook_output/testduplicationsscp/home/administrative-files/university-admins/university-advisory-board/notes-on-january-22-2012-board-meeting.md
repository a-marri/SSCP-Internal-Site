# Notes on January 22, 2012 Board Meeting

Agenda

* Update on Team Progress with Building the carIntroducing a few new members to the board: I'll be bringing along five of the underclassmen members of our team. These are member who will likely be around after I graduate and who may be stepping up into leadership positions on the team next year.Signing the VW contract: I spoke with my contact at VW tonight. He is going to push to see if VWGoA's legal counsel will approve the contract. He said that we should ask Todd Logan to sign the latest contract proposal from Stanford. If VWGoA approves the changes then it will be easy for me to get the signed contract over to VW quickly. If they want additional changes I will have to follow up with Todd.Solar Impulse Race: Our team received an invitation this winter break to participate in a race across the US between a solar plane, a solar trike, and a solar car this upcoming June. A few of the race supporters and organizers are Stanford alum (Ken Howery, Peter Thiel, Tom Currier), so they wanted to know if Stanford could provide a solar car for their race. The plane will be Bertrand Piccard and André Borschberg's Solar Impulse, but they haven't picked a solar trike yet.Finalizing List of Students for Summer Stipends: I'd like to ask Brad Osgood if Chris Gerdes can work with our team to finalize a list of students who will receive summer stipends. I wanted to make sure we have an actual green light to tell students on our team that they don't need to search for internships this summer.Finances: Remaining expenses: $175,800. Expected funding: 54,989 in ASSU, 25,000 VPUE, 62,599 special fees, 25,000 VW, 10,000 ST = $177,588

Shipping the car to Australia

Post Meeting Action Items and notes:

Add Vacuum failure to SOP for the oven

Chris can do a design review for suspension for Nathan Golshan

Send an org chart of team leadership to the board

Make sure that everything form the old board meetings is on OrgSync

Make a list of things to review from the last year's board meetings. At the next board meeting we will review the issues that the board will need to reproach in the future.

The Industrial Contracts office on El Camino will need to sign the VW vehicle contract. Sally wants to know the value. Tell her the mileage.

Ask Susan Weinstein about logos on the Jetta.

The board had a lot of concerns regarding the Solar Impulse Race: publicity concerns, feasibility concerns, logistics concerns, etc. The board wants a pro-con list and another meeting to discuss the event.

Send them the list of email items from the proposal

Set up a decision by Feb 15 for the Solar Impulse Race. Board would have to endorse. May want to have a separate meeting. Invite risk management and name use office.

Donations with strings attached is difficult

Provost and designee have to approve third party contracts

Weekly check in for summer stipends. Can do the organization within the team leadership structure, so Gerdes doesn't have to do too much to manage the people getting summer stipends.

There was a plan for the race overall for Australia last year, but not for shipping in particular. The board doesn't need to be involved with shipping plans
