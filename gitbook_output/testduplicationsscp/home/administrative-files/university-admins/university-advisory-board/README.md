# SSCP - University Advisory Board

# University Advisory Board

Up until 2011 Professor David Davidson was the primary university liaison for the Stanford Solar Car Project. Professor Chris Gerdes and Professor Sven Beiker also played a large role supporting the team, but it was difficult for university admins to ensure that the team complied with university policies. During 2011 the university formed a board of administrators to oversee regulatory issues for the solar car project. The board meets once a quarter with the Team Director.

I focused on keeping the team off the University's radar as much as possible, thought that was always difficult.

Realize that "advising" is a euphemism for "creating red tape" in most circumstances. 90% of the interactions I had with the Advisory Board proved this to be true.

If you want to get resources from the university you usually have to ask for them. I can't remember a time that SAL gave our team significant resources. The student body (via special fees and the ASSU), SoE, the VPUE, and the Provost provided signifiant resources for the team, but the SAL usually just created hassles for me.

Dealing with the university is definitely a delicate dance. Be courteous and responsive when the University asks you to make changes, deal with legal issues, or provide documentation, but try to avoid them asking you to do any of those things in the first place.

Snehal or Nanci will often ask the Team Lead to put together an agenda for the board meeting. I would suggest trying to fill the meeting with as much low-drama topic matter as possible. If you fill time by talking about agreeable stuff like our experience in Australia or our plans for training new members the board will be happy and they won't give you a lot of extra work to do. If you leave the meetings open to the whims of the board many of the administrators will end up digging into the team's business and trying to find ways to increase their oversight over the team. This consequentially makes a lot of extra work for you.

For example, the EH&S people will start asking about waste disposal at VAIL if you let them. SAL will ask a lot of questions about finances. The School of Engineering may ask about how we contact sponsors. Etc. etc. It is not that our team tries to violate school policies, but many of the people on our board have jobs in which their responsibility and productivity is defined by providing oversight over student groups and research labs at Stanford. Consequentially, many people on the board gravitate towards scrutinizing our team rather than supporting our team if you let them. Generally oversight ends up leading towards forms for you to fill out, lawyers you need to talk to, or some other busywork for you.

Be receptive when the board asks you do comply with oversight, but do anything you can up front to avoid unnecessary oversight in the first place. The trust that the University places in our team and the resulting freedom that we have is one of our team's greatest competitive advantages.
