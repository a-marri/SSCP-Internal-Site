Summer 2012

* The  2013 race regulations were announced a few weeks ago. The new  regulations will make some big changes to the way we build our next car.Our  North Carolina trip went smoothly and we collected really promising  data on Xenith's aerodynamic performance. We plan to return next year  with our new car, and we hope to conduct scale model wind tunnel testing  in San Diego or Wichita, Kansas as we do iterations of our new aero  body design later this year.Our team is interested in  purchasing a folding table saw or a table router, so we wanted to know  if the board had any special considerations for that purchase.Additionally,  our team is very serious this cycle about putting 5000 test miles on  our vehicle before the race and restructuring our organization so that  we are more diligent about testing and revising our designs. Reliability  is our team's greatest weakness, so our team wants to have an  operational car well before the start of next summer so that we can do  thorough testing during the summer of 2013. With our traditional student  time resources our team couldn't complete our accelerated build cycle  plan, so a few key members of our team would like to take reduced units  or a leave of absence this spring to work full time to finalize the car.  Additional members are interested in not interning during the following  summer to work full time on the project as well. The largest worry  among the students who want to work full time on the project is finding  room and board for these quarters. I wanted to discuss our plans with  all of you to see if we can get some guidance on applying for outside  grants or funding through Stanford to support our student members  financially. We also hope to ask Stanford R\&DE or the Office of  Financial Aid for room and board on campus for members who would be  finalizing our car during the spring and summer. Hopefully the board  will have some helpful insight on navigating these parts of the  university.Our team is starting to do some planning regarding  composites. We might be able to talk about requirements for our oven,  but this is a lower priority since we probably won't start composites  until after the fall quarter.

Fall 2012

Apogee in the Tech Museum: Stan  Dunn just signed the contract on behalf of Stanford a week ago, so we  are on the final stretch with this project.

Oven: Merry and I finally  received feedback from the SUFMO this morning.

VW contract: This is an issue  that has been blowing up more than I would have liked, but Todd Logan is  helping our team out.

VAIL Reorganization: This has  been happening on the side with Craig Millroy in the PRL making most of  the arrangements.

Stipends: I have been meeting  with Chris Gerdes to finalize the summer stipends for our team.

Composites work in the winter quarter

Winter 2013

* Introducing a few new members to the board: I'll be bringing along five of the underclassmen members of our team. These are member who will likely be around after I graduate and who may be stepping up into leadership positions on the team next year.Signing the VW contract: I spoke with my contact at VW tonight. He is going to push to see if VWGoA's legal counsel will approve the contract. He said that we should ask Todd Logan to sign the latest contract proposal from Stanford. If VWGoA approves the changes then it will be easy for me to get the signed contract over to VW quickly. If they want additional changes I will have to follow up with Todd.Solar Impulse Race: Our team received an invitation this winter break to participate in a race across the US between a solar plane, a solar trike, and a solar car this upcoming June. A few of the race supporters and organizers are Stanford alum (Ken Howery, Peter Thiel, Tom Currier), so they wanted to know if Stanford could provide a solar car for their race. The plane will be Bertrand Piccard and André Borschberg's Solar Impulse, but they haven't picked a solar trike yet.Finalizing List of Students for Summer Stipends: I'd like to ask Brad Osgood if Chris Gerdes can work with our team to finalize a list of students who will receive summer stipends. I wanted to make sure we have an actual green light to tell students on our team that they don't need to search for internships this summer.Finances: Remaining expenses: $175,800. Expected funding: 54,989 in ASSU, 25,000 VPUE, 62,599 special fees, 25,000 VW, 10,000 ST = $177,588
