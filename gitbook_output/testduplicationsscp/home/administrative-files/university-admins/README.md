### The sorts of things that different Stanford admins do:

[](#h.2vtfgvu11a5x)

Philip McLaughlin, Mitchell Bousson, and Anica Kodzoman: work in the Fleet garage, getting preventative maintenance on the van and the trailer, getting insurance and registration updated for the van and trailer, getting repairs on team vehicles (minus the solar car).

Eddie Morales and Chris Crismon: Are admins for VAIL, you can email them when things at VAIL break. They are the department property administrators for VAIL. They have helped with disposing solar car molds

Keith Gaul (gaul@ee.stanford.edu) Director of EE Instructional Labs -Has helped sourcing old computers, borrowing test equipment, names of test equipment              donors.

Merry Weeks: EH&S safety issues, if someone could die or if someone could sue the school Merry Weeks will get involved. She worked on approving our oven proposal. She worked on legal issues for getting Apogee in the Tech Museum

Stan Dunn: He helps the team whenever we want to sell assets (MPPTs, solar panels). He is pretty good, but sometimes you need to send him reminders. He also helped with legal issues for getting Apogee in the Tech Museum. 

Jo Anne Thorne: Helps with insurance issues. Email her if someone needs proof of our liability insurance. If you have the choice of working with Jo Anne or Diana Haven choose Jo Anne. Jo Anne is a lot more friendly, helpful, and quick.

Brad Osgood: Is a student affairs person for the school of engineering. He has helped out with funding students for research grants.

Neil Morimoto: Industrial Contracts Office. Will have input for NDA agreements

Todd Logan: Gets involved when SSCP is talking to big sponsors. He is one of the people that has to approve our sponsorship requests

Diana Haven: Diana Haven serves the same role as Jo Anne, but she is less friendly and less quick.

Sandy Meyer

Sven Beiker: Keep VAIL looking decently clean and you won't have problems with Sven. Remember he has short temper.

Chris Gerdes: Is the team's biggest ally among admins/profs at Stanford. He is pretty busy with the DDL lab, but he can help with just about anything if you ever need to escalate an issue or get someone to back the team up in conflicts with the university. 4 weeks around Commencement are busy for professors like Gerdes. When Gerdes teaches machine design class he is also busy: 4th week of the quarter and later.  

Nanci Howe: Is the director of some sort of SAL. She and Snehal organize our advisory board meetings. She will have input for everything that you ask her about.
