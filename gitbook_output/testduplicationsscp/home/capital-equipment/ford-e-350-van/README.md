### RIP E350

Unfortunately, the van's life officially ended in July, 2024 during the Formula Sun Grand Prix. The van made it all the way from Stanford to Bowling Green, KY, towing the vehicle in the trailer. A team member (Jack West) took it to a local restaurant in Bowling Green, where the engine seized due to a coolant leak. Fleet management decided to scrap the vehicle (I think), and it remains in Bowling Green to this day.

History

The van was rented from a local Ford dealership for a race awhile back - we returned it in such terrible condition that they just donated it to us. Since then, the vehicle has become Stanford Fleet Vehicle #1950, and is insured and maintained by the Fleet Garage.

The van is a 2001 E-350 Super Duty

Insurance for the van will probably be around $1290.00 a year through the university.

Don't forget to use overdrive mode. There is a button on the shift lever.

The Stanford Fleet Garage provides maintenance for the van. The Fleet Garage will ask us to bring in the van once every four months for preventative maintenance.

Maintenance

In the Winter of 2012, the van was repaired: brake shoes, transmission oil, fixed differential, A/C check. The details are in Estimate Veh 1950.pdf

In the spring of 2013 the van had a leak in the AC compressor. The van has yet to be repaired as fo 6/23/2013

Sam Lenius said that for a similar Minnesota vehicle it is faster overall to drive slowly, save gas, and not refuel than to drive quickly, burn a lot of gas, and spend 20 min ever two hours refilling your tank. Driving the van below 60mph is probably good for everything.

In March or so of 2014, the van got its spark plugs and engine coils changed. Spark plug replacements were standard, engine coils were aftermarket upgrades from original Ford models.&#x20;

As of Dec 9, 2014, the van's AC has been repaired.

During the 2018-19 cycle the van was smogged and given "preventative maintenance" by fleet garage. Team members also sealed a leak in the upper seam of the windshield where water had been able to get in.

The Van's smog test was renewed in the spring of 2021, and it underwent some general servicing and repairs from the fleet garage, including receiving a new battery.
