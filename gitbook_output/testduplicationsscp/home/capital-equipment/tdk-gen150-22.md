# SSCP - TDK GEN150-22

# TDK GEN150-22

A 2U, 3.3kW, 0-150V, 0-22A power supply! Doubles as our pack charger in Australia.

Serial Communication

The supply is programmable via RS-232! Here are some tips:

* Read chapter 7 of the attached manual
* Make sure that SW1, pin 6 is DOWN for RS232 (rather than RS485)
* Use ADDR 6, 9600 baud
* Use the Toughbook's COM port. Known functional USB-serial converters include [none yet]
* PUTTY works fine, but try Hyperterminal (installation for Win7), because you can see what you're typing
