## Vinyl Wrapping VW Vehicles

From Mark @ Maverick Label

Depending on how particular you are for the application of the vinyl, I highly suggest thoroughly cleaning the application area. Any bits of dust or fibers will cause a small bump underneath the vinyl. It will be unnoticeable from several feet away, but will look more obvious the closer you get. Using a clay bar to remove contaminants on the paint would probably be overkill, a thorough wash or wiping of the area and drying should get you set.

From Wesley on designing graphics for the VW Jetta in 2013:

I found a high resolution stock image of our VW car. I laid out some graphics in a Power Point file (see attached). Gave it to our Advisory Board for them to review. Then I gave it to VW to review. When everyone was happy I took the images and converted them to .AI files. I called up Maverick Labels and renewed our sponsorship. I sent Maverick Labels the .AI files and a document explaining how large in real life each logo needed to be. Make sure you put the VW logo on a white background; VW is picky about the background of their logo.

I'll attach the logo files I sent to Maverick Labels. Here are my contacts from Maverick

Also, if Maverick Labels falls through I think we had a Vistaprint Sponsorship for Xenith.
