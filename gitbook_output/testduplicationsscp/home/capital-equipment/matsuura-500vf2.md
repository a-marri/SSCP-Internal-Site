For complete documentation on the machines including manuals for both the controls and machine see the CNC documentation folder on the ftp server. For mechanical and wiring diagrams of the machine look inside of the controls.

The following is a list of all the problems the team has encountered while operating the CNC machine. Since there is not very good information on the internet about our machine its very difficult to debug even simple problems at times.&#x20;

Problems and Solutions:

Date: Fall 2012

Problem: NC Int Light turns on

Resolution: The NC  Int is an interlock for the tool changer indicating the controls are not sure what position the tool changer is in. To remove the interlock manually move the tool changer so that it is on one of the two limit switches at either end of its travel.&#x20;

Date: Fall 2012

Problem: Zero Return not working

Resolution: Replaced a broken zero return switch on the control panel.

Date: Fall 2012

Problem: ATC problem: Erro 411: M06 error 3&#x20;

Resolution: Rotated the ATC motor until Diagnostic number #1013D5 reads 0.

Date: Fall 2012

Problem: Investigating Backlash

More Information: Using the SSCP feeler indicator, the backlash of the CNC was measured. It was measured at 0 in the Y direction and .0003" in the X direction. Z was not measured.

Suggestions: Edit the backlash parameters to correctly match the machine's backlash. Not done as of Sep 2012

Date: Summer 2012

Problem: "G02/G03 Error"

Resolution: The machine is commanded to do a helical move with a G03 move, but our machine does not support X,Y,Z at the same time.

More Information: If you have done everything else correctly (no ramps or helical moves). Un-check the post processor flag for helical moves.

Date: Spring 2012

Problem: Machine hits "breakpoints" executing programs generated by HSMworks.

Resolution: Unknown

Date: Spring 2012

Problem: Machine wouldn't x,y,z zero.

Solution: Rotate the position encoders by 90 deg at a time until it does zero.

More Information: Since the zero position is given by the encoder tick after the zero switch is hit, the rotation of the encoder can be important.

Date: Spring 2012

Problem: Machine wouldn't tool change: Error 400 Sequence Error 2, User message 411 Error 3.&#x20;

Resolution: Punched the reset button on every relay, swapped the air lines on the tool changer lifter cylinder, moved it up and down by hand. While it was down, I rotated the magazine one rotation by hand. Then, I removed relay 105cx and replaced it. Waved hands. It worked.

More Information:

Presumably caused by the tool changer getting stuck on rotate by a yellow cylinder.

Date: Summer 2011

Problem: Machine was stuck in Emergency Stop

Resolution: Replacing the coolant pump and resetting the relay that gives it power.

More Information:

&#x20;   Like many machine tools there is more than the big red emergency stop button in the emergency disconnect circuit. There are many different elements that are wired in series and if any one of these breaks contact the machine will hard stop with an emergency stop. Thinks on the Matsuura that are known to be in this circuit are the hard over travel switches on x,y, and z, the red button on the controls, and the reset relay for the coolant pump. There are invariably other systems tied into the emergency disconnect that were not listed. The coolant pump relay in question is at the bottom of the left cabinet if one is looking at the front of the machine. &#x20;

Date: Summer 2011

Problem: CNC controls displaying garbage&#x20;

Resolution: Pay a tech 2.5k to fix the problem

More Information:&#x20;

&#x20;   The controls are the one thing on the machine that no one on the team is equipped to fix and are easily the most complex and expensive part of old CNC machines. We used CNC Machine Resources and had a good experience. Noel, the owner and sole employee, had a career at Yaskawa (the company that made all the electronics on the machine) and seems quite knowledgeable, charges about 75% of what his former employer would, and is very accommodating.&#x20;

Date: Summer 2011

Problem: Alarm 393 on x and y axis

Resolution: Replace differential line driver chip on x and y encoders

More Information:

&#x20;   Alarm 393 means that there is a problem with the feedback on the axis (aka encoder). The encoder only has 3 ICs: a standard op amp, quad comparator, and differential line driver. Both the op amp and comparetor have high input voltage ranges while the line driver in addition to having a max recommended operating voltage of 5.25, is also the only chip exposed to the outside world.&#x20;

Date: Winter 2012

Problem: Zero returns not working.

Resolution: Disabled zero return check in parameters by changing 6006 bit 2 to 0.

More Information:

&#x20;   After a power cycle the machine checks to see that it has been zero returned. Since that functionality does not appear to be working we disabled it for the time being. The full consequences of this hack are unknown.&#x20;

Date: Winter 2012

Problem: Controls not booting when power applied

Resolution: Increase voltage on 5V rail to 5.15

More Information:

&#x20;   The Yasnac maintenance manual specifies that the applied voltage on the 5v rail needs to be +5.15 exactly. There appears to be about .15V drop across the wires to the controls itself so the voltage at the controls is 5V when the power supply output is 5.15.

Date: Winter 2012

Problem: Controls displays Th (horizontal tape parity error)

Resolution: Change RS-232 Parameter

More Information:

&#x20;   When the controls got fixed the RS-232 interface parameters got reset to their default values. There are four sets of values that actually control the interface. The baud rate, number of stop bits, enabling flow control, and setting the default interface to RS-232.&#x20;

Date: Spring 2012

Problem: Error Code 20&#x20;

Resolution: Make sure Job Folder Coordinate System matches specific Job Coordinate System in CAM

More Information:

&#x20;   G Code "G68" is the causing code, for Work Coordinate System Rotation.

&#x20;   Change work coordinate systems to match and then restart CNC machine
