Follow-Up From ANSYS Presentation (7/20/2016)

Dear all,

Thanks again for letting us present to the group on Wednesday. It was a pleasure for us to be there and we keep talking about how amazing the work you are doing is. Definitely inspiring!

Could you please pass the information below to the team members? 

Please find the PDF of the presentation attached. As you remember, the videos were somewhat a failure so I am sending the links directly :)
