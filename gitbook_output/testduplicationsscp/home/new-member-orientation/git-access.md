## SSCP - Git Access

## Git Access

We use git to develop code. Our github organization is located here: https://github.com/sscp/

[https://github.com/sscp/](https://github.com/sscp/)

In the past (pre sundae), we've used SVN to develop code. See SVN for Apogee, Xenith, Luminos, and Arctan code.

Access

Get one of the owners of the SSCP github organization (Currently Maisam and Simon) to grant you access.

You'll need access to 3 things:

The sscp organization - You'll need to be a part of the sscp organization to join teams

Git Policies

* See the 'Etiquette' section in SVN Access; much of that is relevant.Read this guide on the branching/pull request workflow.Create a new branch for every project, and only merge it into master when it has been appropriately code reviewed. Commit often, show your work. From a document at Facebook: "There's a natural urge to wait and polish the code to accomplish a particular task so that it appears to have sprung into existence as a large, perfect whole. This tendency is especially strong if you're a new engineer looking to prove yourself. However, you should resist this urge; generally, the more code your diff encompasses, the harder it is to review:"One thesis per commit - each diff should serve one and only one purpose.
