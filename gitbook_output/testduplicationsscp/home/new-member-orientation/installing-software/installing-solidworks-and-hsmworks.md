## Installing Solidworks (and HSMWorks)

**Please note: Solidworks only works with Windows x64 (7-10). Therefore, if you have a Mac, you will need to create a Windows partition using software included with your Mac.**

### Bootcamping for Mac users:

You're going to need to Bootcamp your machine in order to run windows in a separate hard drive partition before you can install SolidWorks.\*

Get your copy of Windows from the Stanford Software Store.  Download Windows. All licenses are free, so choose whichever you prefer.

[Stanford Software Store](https://stanford.onthehub.com/WebStore/Welcome.aspx)

If you are on Mac, run a spotlight search (command + Spacebar) for "Boot Camp Assistant", and open the Boot Camp Assistant tool.  Follow the instructions to install Windows.

Most problems with Bootcamping (if applicable) can be resolved by deleting the partition and trying again. If that doesn't work, it might be time to bust out the google-fu :).

\*For the most part, it seems like virtual machines are not allocated enough computing resources to run Solidworks. We recommend partitioning your drive with Bootcamp. However, there have been people who've used a VM to run Solidworks, so if you're really bent on it, go for it. Just be prepared to have to Bootcamp and reinstall Solidworks anyways.

VPN

If you're off campus, you'll have to VPN in to Stanford's network to install and use Solidworks. You can find instructions on how to VPN here.

### Downloading Solidworks

Download for free from the library here:

https://library.stanford.edu/englib/using-terman/computers-equipment-software/solidworks

_outdated instructions below, we no longer use filezilla for cad, we use google drive_

Follow the instructions on the SFTP page, and download the folder Software > Solidworks 17 SP5.0 IM. Please note that this can over an hour (at least off-campus) since some of these files are pretty large.

[SFTP](../../../../../stanford.edu/testduplicationsscp/home/new-member-orientation/sftp-access/)

You can also check out a flash drive with the Solidworks installation files from Terman Engineering Library.

### IMPORTANT: Installing

Follow the instructions detailed in the PDM Access page.
