In the beginning

When we sat down and designed Xenith, we first tried to deal with the rule change for the 2011 race. For 2011, the WSC officials changed two details, both of which were officially set in stone on June 5: the first item was  the limitation of Gallium Arsenide arrays to 3 m^2  and the consolidation of all cars into a single class. The goal was to allow silicon cars to be competitive with cars that spent a bunch of money. Given that we had recently recruited Danny, who knew more about aero than any member of the team for quite a while, this narrowed down our choices for the car by quite a bit:

&#x20;   Option 1: Car with concentrator, thicker to accommodate the concentrator apparatuses

&#x20;   Option 2: Car with 6 m^2 of silicon, thinner because silicon only occupies space on the top

Based on calculations we did based on optical losses, efficiency, and heat dissipation problems, we concluded that concentrators were probably not the right way to go. We (correctly) assumed that they would be difficult to implement and started work designing a car intended for 6 m^2 of silicon. There were several other features that were floating around during the beginning of the design process: rear wheel steering, a glass array, a curved chassis. More about these later.

In the beginning of the design process, we established the general dimensions of the car. We established that the car should be as close to the maximum length as possible, as thin as mechanically possible (to reduce our CdA, and with the driver positioned at the position required by the rules. This allowed the sub-teams to begin design work.

The features of the car evolved as we worked on them, but the following is a table of the features, their intention, and result, that we planned to integrate into the car to give us a competitive edge.
