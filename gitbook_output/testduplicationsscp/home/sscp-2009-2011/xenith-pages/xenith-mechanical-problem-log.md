## Xenith Mechanical Problem Log

### Pre WSC 2011:

### WSC 2011:

#### Rear Linkage Delamination:

Originally the bottom linkages of the rear suspension where made of .75OD carbon fiber tube with glued titanium inserts for the rod ends. A failure on the road would have caused the rear wheel to lock at full turn and the car would become uncontrollable.

In the future all glue joints between carbon and metal that the structural integrity of the car depends on should be tested in the composites lab for fatigue and maximum yeild strength.&#x20;

#### Motor Failure

The motor was prevented from rotating in Xenith with a .250" dowel pin. This pin, during a wheel change, was pressed into its hole by incorrect installation. The pin was supposed to have been press-fit, it was glued in place instead. Without a dowel pin, the motor stator spun in place, damaging the stator and pulling out 2/3 of the motor phase lines. The stator was repaired on the spot with solder and fire, and a new dowel pin hacked onto the motor, costing \~2 hours on the race.

### Post WSC 2011:

#### Pressure Pro Box VHB Fail:

While doing a campus test drive a pressure pro box VHBed to the fairing bulkhead delaminated and got caught in the wheel stopping it. This managed to wear through all the plastic on one of the polycase boxes, rub the insulation off a phoenix cable and damage the carbon of the fairing.&#x20;

In the future anything in the wheel well or in the same area as the wheel should be bolted to ensure that it could never detach and stop the wheel from rotating.&#x20;

#### Motor Stater Failure:

While on a test drive on campus the stator began to rub on one side of the magnet plates. The cause is believed to be the omission or improper installation of a spacer in the motor stackup. The motor was assembled without the space, and eventually components became loose and moved while driving.
