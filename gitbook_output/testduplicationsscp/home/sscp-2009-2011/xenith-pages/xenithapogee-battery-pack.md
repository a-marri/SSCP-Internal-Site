## Xenith/Apogee Battery Pack

Description:&#x20;

The goal of this project is to get new members to design a new battery pack for Xenith/Apogee, giving us a second generation battery pack. This will:

1. Teach new members how to use and get an intro to:Basic prototyping and sketchingSolidworks, workgroupPDM Design reviewsBasic machiningCNC machiningIntro composites/gluing stuff for beginners
