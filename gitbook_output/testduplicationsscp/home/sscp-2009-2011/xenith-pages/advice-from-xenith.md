# SSCP - Advice from Xenith

# Advice from Xenith

Here are a number of things that we can improve from the baseline of Xenith's (and Apogee's) performance in WSC '09, ASC '10, and WSC '11:

## Rear Wheel Steering

[](#h.cvm3ubqf679m)

* No rear wheel steering. I know it worked just fine, but it didn't actually give us an advantage, and it made the motor attachment more difficult, which in turn cost us the race. Also, this was a very heavy part of the car, and we need to reduce weight in order to be competitive with the top teams who have 125kg cars. Steel tubing, a heavy actuator, and a motor controller are just unnecessary. Also, rear wheel steering does funky stuff to Ackerman steering (see VincentG's comment near the bottom in this discussion: http://www.solarwebsite.nl/2011/10/world-solar-challenge-2011-update-7-dagen-te-gaan/), meaning that it makes the wheels scrub more even when going straight (and sailing).

## Suspension

[](#h.kmfwemfjduod)

* Suspension design. Apogee and Equinox (and even Solstice) had excellent suspension design, thanks to guys like Ryan McCullough, Vivian Lee, and John Shen. This tried and true suspension worked very well at damping the roughness of the road, although I think we could go with even more travel. Umicar Inspire (2009) as well as many other solar car I have seen had a-arm length in excess of 12 inches. We should design our suspension to be very much like F1 car suspensions, as our goals are in some ways very similar (good handling, good aero).Front suspension. I know why we didn't have suspension, but it turned out to screw us over because the car shook too much, which cost us more than the reduction in frontal area that it gave us. Apogee and all of our earlier cars have very good suspension, which made them easier to control, faster around the track, and critically damped. We probably want more suspension travel, I think 100mm or 120mm is a good target. After deciding on suspension geometry and choosing a shock, details such as spring rate and damping coefficient of the shock should be used in a full-on suspension dynamic analysis (this can be done in MATLAB, by someone who took ME161).Rear suspension. The rear suspension should be something between that of Apogee's and Xenith's. The CSIRO motor is great (if we don't break it), but (I think) it requires support from both sides. This is actually good because it makes the car more laterally stiff. However, we can save a lot of weight by making it out of machined aluminum billet or titanium tubes. Titanium is great, but it requires longer lead times and sourcing problems, in addition to special mitering, bending, and welding equipment.Have Gerdes help with suspension design. Get it to be like a Lexus. (Though the bouncing aerobody may not have been as big of a problem as we thought Xenith Aero Analysis Part 2)If you want to have a better suspension and new roll cage to fix rear suspension then you have to redo molds and layup

If you want to have a better suspension and new roll cage to fix rear suspension then you have to redo molds and layup

* Simpler suspension design. We'll have to measure the relationship between stiffness and aero drag, since this seems to have been a big issue during WSC2011. The thin aerobody in the front suspension area was a big risk, and it didn't pay off. It seems reasonable to go with double A-arms on the front and a one-sided trailing arm, like the top teams (really? I though the CSIRO motor was normally run with a two-sided trailing arm). The top teams had much longer suspension travel than even Apogee, let alone Xenith. We'll probably use coilovers again and make sure that our suspension is critically damped (Xenith's probably wasn't).

## Tires

[](#h.khijopve6602)

* Tires. Sadly, the most important mechanical component in the car are the tires, and we had some serious fail on this front. We invested far too little on tire procurement and tire-related tooling during this project cycle. I think nitrogen filling is a great idea, as well as using something more sophisticated than a garage compressor to fill our tires to the correct pressure is in order. Also, the failure of our suspension to fit the tire profile leads me to believe that we need mechanical design reviews with alumni so we can have fresh eyes picking over the assumptions and mistakes that we do in mechanical design.If you want michelins you have to redo the aerobody"Michelins. We need them."

## Mule Car

[](#h.891z8qae8x6t)

* Mule car. We should consider making a mule, or test chassis on which we can test the suspension, motor, steering, and electronics design. This will ensure that our suspension is well designed and that the car is critically damped. Putting miles on this car will result in bombproof electronics and a well-tested motor. Design lessons learned on this quick prototype (welded steel construction in the PRL) will result in better design for the finished product. If we make the design modular (like Gerdes' car X1), we can use it in later design cycles. (The team attempted to put in motion a mule design project at the start of the 2013 cycle, and realized that it would require too much time and effort. Before we could get any designs put together, the time came to start designing the actual race entry. We decided not to continue the project for the 2015 cycle.)

## Spares

## Weight

[](#h.jsbdl7bx9rxd)

* Weight! Each component should be carefully considered, analyzed, and we should put some thinking into how to make it lighter. This is what Aurora does each design cycle, and new team members come up with good ideas on weight reduction. See Composites for more ideas on weight reduction and composites analysis.
