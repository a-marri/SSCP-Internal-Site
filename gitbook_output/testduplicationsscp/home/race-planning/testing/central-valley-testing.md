Pro Tips

Mendota/Firebaugh/Madera/Fresno drives

* There are rest stops on the northbound and southbound lanes of I5 just north of Nees Ave. They have restrooms, trees for hammocks, a shipping container people like to sleep on, and easy parking for the van and trailer. The only downsides are that there are no showers, the sprinklers water the grass at night (so you don't want to sleep on the grass), and the semis at the rest stop leave their engines idling at night. Technically you can't pitch tents at the rest stop or stay for more than 8 hours. It is difficult to get from one side of I5 to another if you miss your exit.South of the rest stop there is a Chevron gas station with a SubwayW Nees Ave is a nice staging area for test drives. There is a wide dirt pull out on the right side of the road immediately after exiting I5For a short loop take Poleline Rd. to Eagle Field Road. Eagle Field turns into West Athena. Turn south on N. Oxford or on Russell Ave. Return to Poleline Rd. on W Nees Ave.For longer drives leave the trailer on W. Nees Ave and drive the solar car to Manning Ave. You can take Highway 33 or N Fairfax to Belmont to Derrick Ave.Manning Ave between the Aqueduct after I5 and San Joaquin is possibly the flattest road in the Central Valley. You can drive on Manning Road all the way until you reach the foothills at the east end of the Central Valley. You will pass through a few towns with some stop lights and merge lanes. Manning Ave is generally very flat with a couple of steepish overpasses.Make sure you don't leave behind any tools you might need if you drive to the East end of Manning Ave. The east end will be 100 miles from your trailer, so you'd hate to drive 200 miles to bring a spare tire for your car or something silly like that.On your way back to Stanford from Manning Ave I'd recommend stopping in Los Banos. There is an El Grullense, a Jamba Juice, a Home Depot, and a gravel lot with space for parking the trailer at the corner of Pacheco Blvd and Place Rd.

Chico/RedBluff drives

* The team did a couple of days of testing in Chico on highway 99 in 2013. However, this testing proved to be of limited value for the team. We originally targeted highway 99 to get a flat stretch of road with no stop signs. However, we still spent enough time stopped at the turn around points and in Red Bluff that the test wasn't as controlled as we hoped. Also, there is enough daily commute traffic on highway 99 that we pissed off a lot of people by driving slowly and obstructing traffic on their daily commute route. Plus there are enough trees along Highway 99 that we had a lot of array shading. You may have to wait until you are in South Australia to have perfect testing conditions. The team also scoured maps of California, Nevada, Utah, and Oregon trying to find a better alternative.
