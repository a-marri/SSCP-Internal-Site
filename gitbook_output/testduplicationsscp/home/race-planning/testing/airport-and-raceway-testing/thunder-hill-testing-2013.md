## Thunder Hill Testing 2013

Thunder Hill is a medium sized racetrack in Willows, CA. It is probably your best option for closed course testing in California. Alameda Point is too expensive. Moffett Field has too much red tape and delays. Other airports probably won't let solar cars onto the runway for testing (even the small ones like Half Moon Bay). The DDL uses Thunder Hill on a somewhat regular basis, so start by asking Chris Gerdes if the solar car project could use part of the track while they are testing. In 2013 the team used turns 6-9. The car started on the hill of turn 9 and then cruised downhill towards turn 8. We set up our tests between turn 7 and 8. Then the car had the straight between turn 7 and 6 to slow down and turn around. It is good to use a section of the track with a hill so that the car can build up enough speed to reach racing speeds.

If you have to go to Thunder Hill without piggybacking on the DDL talk to David Vodden (the CEO) dvodden@thunderhill.com 530-934-5588,  Stuart Seitz Stuart.seitz@gmail.com, or Shannon shannon@thunderhill.com. They should all like us. In 2013 they quoted us $2675 for a full day of testing.
