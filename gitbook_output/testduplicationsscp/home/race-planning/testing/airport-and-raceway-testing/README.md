Alameda Airports: The current ownership of the Alameda Airstrip isn't super clear. It looks like the City of Alameda owns it, but I'm not sure who manages it. There are currently bids to develop Alameda Point into a commercial district. CalSol was able to work with someone named Damon Vander Lind  at Makani Power to get access to the strip in 2012.

* Danielle Roth: droth@pmrg.com. June is booked, but May is more open. She will send us an application. The fee for 24 hours is $2,000. They can probably prorate the track for shorter test sessions, but she will check. The runway is 1 mile long. There is a 55 mph speed limit officially.
