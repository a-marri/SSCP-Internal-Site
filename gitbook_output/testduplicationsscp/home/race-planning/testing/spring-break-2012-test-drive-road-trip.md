## Spring Break 2012 Test Drive Road Trip

We're going on a road trip!

The Solar Car Project will be going on the first mock race of the next race cycle this spring break and you all should be there! Mock races are super fun and important because you will quickly learn the skills of being on a race crew and you get to enjoy all of the excitement of racing a solar car.

We are planning this trip so that we can get valuable data on Xenith while not interfering with your other spring break plans. You all should be able to come on this trip and go wherever you plan to vacation for spring break.

Here are the preliminary details:

* We will have two groups leaving Stanford at different times on Friday the 23rd, the last day of finals. Most of you will probably be done with finals before Friday, so the majority of the team will leave Stanford Friday morning.
* Those who have finals on Friday should be finished by 3:15. We'll give you some time to decompress and then another set of carpool groups will leave Friday afternoon.
* Our race route hasn't been finalized yet because we will alter the route based on weather conditions. Wherever we go it will surely be fun.
* The main group will start driving Xenith on Friday. We'll teach everyone the fundamentals of escorting the solar car through traffic, working as a caravan, fulfilling race day duties, and responding to tire change and other repair drills.
* We may have tryouts for new car drivers that weekend.
* While we are driving Xenith around the state we will also be logging new performance data using a different set of tires. The batch of tires that we had in OZ weren't ideal, so we want new data with different tires.
* The mock race will run a lot like the World Solar Challenge. We'll have checkpoints for lunch and we'll be camping (or getting rooms if it is raining) at night.
* We will run full-day mock races and testing on Saturday the 24th and Sunday the 25th. On Sunday evening we will arrive back at Stanford. Book your flights for Monday the 26th.

This basic outline shouldn't change much, and we will send out more details as we finalize our plans. A few things may remain secret until the actual event, but that just makes everything more exciting.&#x20;

TLDR: For now, all you need to remember is that you will be on an awesome road trip from March 23rd to 25th, so you should book flights that leave on Monday the 26th or afterwards. You'll RSVP later.
