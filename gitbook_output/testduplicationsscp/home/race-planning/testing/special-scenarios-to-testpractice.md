Tire blowout

Regen does something funky while you're driving (that was the sign that the motor was borked last time).  Proper response: turn the car off and use mechanical brakes to stop.

Accelerator pedal stops working

Mechanical brakes stop working (oh shit)

Brake pedal miscalibrated

Accelerator pedal miscalibrated

Tire alignment is bad

Cruise control fails--keeps kicking out of cruise, sets speed too low or too high, or turns on when you don't expect it.

Steering is sticky or sloppy
