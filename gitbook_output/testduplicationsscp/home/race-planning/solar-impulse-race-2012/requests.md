* Stipends for students to take the spring or winter quarter off to work full time on the project.$8,000 - $10,000 per studentWe could alternatively consider providing group food and group housing with a smaller stipend per student.I estimated that each individual student working for 10 weeks could save 1.5 - 2 weeks for the entire team, so this would be around $4,500 per week of time savings.We have five core members who are already willing to take time off with a stipend, and we could probably persuade others to take the quarter off as well.
