# SSCP - Thoughts on Participating in the Race

# Thoughts on Participating in the Race

Combined thoughts from the team

Our team is about to make a large decision regarding a race across the US this June. Please read the emails below from Tom Currier. He is working with Ken Howery (part of the Peter, Elon, Max, & Luke PayPal team) to organize a race between a solar plane (Solar Impulse), a solar car, and a solar trike. He is looking for a solar car for Ken to drive in the event and he was interested in our team since he, Ken, and Peter are Stanford alumni.

I spoke to Tom this evening. Flying Solar Impulse from California to New York is already a firmly planned event, but he is still making early arrangements to add the solar car and solar trike aspects.

The race would be in mid June which should be the same time we have a finished car. However, at our current rate of progress that car may not be road worthy for a cross continental trip. Peter and Ken are willing to pitch in cash resources to make the event worth our time, but we haven't discussed actual numbers yet.

Benefits:

* It would force us to have a 3000 mile race ready car by June. If we make it to NY we would have one of the most well tested solar cars in the team's recent history going into WSC 2013.We would get funding from Peter and Ken, but the value is still undetermined. I proposed that they consider covering expenses such as outsourcing machining, outsourcing the solar array to Chuzzel or Gochermann, spring quarter stipends for students to work on the car, travel expenses for the US race, etc.The team, the university, and our sponsors would get a lot of press coverage. Tom mentioned Top Gear, but I personally don't believe Top Gear would dedicate all that much time to this sort of eventWe could swing by Aerodyn on the way back from New York for our wind tunnel testing.We would probably get to meet with Solar Impulse's engineers (especially their aero engineers) and people like Ken Howery, Peter Thiel, and Bertrand Piccard. Think about this - a bunch of us will be wanting to do startups in the near/medium term - who better to know than Peter Thiel?I think the hard deadline and a clear goal is worth a lot. If they can put in enough cash to basically pay for all of the expedited manufacturing then this is a no-brainer. I'd imagine that it would take on order or $150-200k to give us the resources to rapid-turn all of the things between where we are and where we would need to be. Insurance companies will cover anything with enough prodding and lubrication.also: if top gear actually airs a few minutes of this, that would probably be more exposure than all of WSC gets

Costs:

* It would force us to have a 3000 mile race ready car by June. The team would have to reallocate a lot of time resources in the winter and spring towards expediting the manufacturing of our car. We would probably want to have two race ready cars so we can trailer a replacement car behind the first. We don't want a bunch of embarrassing media while we repair a car on the side of the road. Also, Ken (5' 9") is probably too tall for Xenith, and I'm not sure if we want to refurbish Apogee. Tom mentioned that they would prefer to help us get a new car ready than to pull out an old car.Ken could conceivably crash one of our cars, and we would have to deal with insurance issues before the race.We would need more people (5-10) to take the spring quarter off to finish the car, but those people might be paidWe would have to outsource a lot of our manufacturing, but we can still make WSC backup components in house after the US race if we want the hands on experienceThe race would be a logistics distraction at the start of our summerWe would spend a few weeks away from VAIL at the start of the summerHowever, I'm not sure if it's a good idea for the team to have someone else driving the car for this entire race. On an emotional level, first - this is going to be our car and I have a feeling a lot of us would really love to drive it on it's first serious race. Far more importantly, for safety - it's *very* important to our success on the race that not only we have a thoroughly tested car, but that we have drivers that intuitively understand all the subtle things about the car's behavior so they can be confident on the road. IMO, that's a big safety issue. Maybe we could have him drive a fair distance, but also rotate in our own race drivers?
