# SSCP - Checklist for Winning a Solar Car Race

# Checklist for Winning a Solar Car Race

Priority number one is to build a fast solar car--a simple goal that Stanford, despite ten attempts over twenty years, has yet to achieve.

"Checklist for winning a solar car race" is probably too much to promise--after all, we've never come particularly close. But we have found a lot of creative ways to fail, so we'll start with avoiding those. We also took a close look at the winning teams, and they have more than a few things in common.

* Mechanical Design Review on every component in the car as a wrap-up of the design phase. Invite relevant alumni like Paul Karplus, Junior Mechanic Lambert and John Shen...Electrical Design Review should also be performed on every board, inviting relevant alumni like Sasha...Set a ship date for the car that's at least a few months before race day. Preferably a hard deadline, like Race to Vegas.Set a ship date for the rolling chassis even earlier. Preferably a hard deadline, like a windtunnel appointment.Go to a windtunnel. Preferably with scale models, definitely with the finished car.Go on test drives, and make them as close as possible to race days. Strategy should predict power consumption and power production beforehand, then measure during the drive.Make sure that telemetry is easy to use. Any engineer on the team should be able to get data from the car.Make sure that the electrical system is simple and easy to debug. Boards should be independently testable, with or without the BPS.Make sure that the mechanical system is simple. All of the top cars at WSC2011 were incredibly light (~140kg) and had simple mech systems.Bring backups. Get as close as possible to straight up bringing two cars.Don't build stuff unless it increases power production or reduces power consumption. At one point, Xenith had a driver controls design with a see-through Borg display and an iPod adapter. It then went on to consume 1500+ watts at 90kph.Corollary: don't redesign stuff if it worked perfectly well on the last car.Test it.Test it again.Test it some more.Risk. "I think we need to more carefully control for risk on our project. Of course, there is a lot of risk inherantly involved in building a solar car, but the more we can eliminate unknows, the better we will do. As many of you know, Tokai took almost no risk at WSC, and they won. The only significant part of their car that changed in any appreciable way was their array. Twente and Nuna have "mule" cars in which they test suspension to observe performance and make modifications if neccessary. Michigan tested their car at FSGP and set a really early completion date, and this paid off as they were able to completely rebuild their car as a light, faster vehicle. We took a huge amount of risk with sailing, completely new suspension design, new encapsulation, small frontal area, new motor, and titanium reinforced carbon chassis. Encapsulation and titanium carbon worked well, but sailing, front area, motor, and suspension didn't. We should pick our battles and focus our energy on winning, no just being innovative.""As for the next car, I think that taking the car into a wind tunnel and getting the faculty (aero-astro and mechanical, maybe even ee if we can get sweet cells or something) involved would be a good idea. As I said, better suspension design, better chassis design, and better teamwork/design reviews/testing will make the difference between a repeat of the last two races and a breakthrough car and team. I really think we can take the basic design of Xenith and modify it to support two-wheel steering, better suspension travel, and stiffer chassis.""Everyone must have set tasks during the race. It is the only was to race competitively.""We need to develop a set of race protocol that are well known by everyone. Things like: how radio is used, what tasks should be done in what order, what the driver should do given a set of circumstances (i.e. if radio dies, should they pull over?). When it is okay to goof off and when you need to be at battle stations. Who has the final call on what. How to pass another solar car. What scumbag scout should be doing. ""Everyone on the team should read and understand the race rules.""Team tasks need to be divided more efficiently. Some people were totally swamped a times when other people were standing by with nothing to do.""People need to be willing to do work outside of their expertise if they want to come on the race, otherwise 20 people is too many if many people are idle.""Have a separate "race leader" and "technical leader" that are in constant communication, with very defined responsibilities.""We need to take deadlines more seriously. I know things get hectic and then we end up missing some "deadlines," but if it were a higher team priority to meet these, and there were more of a consensus on what needs to be done when, we could have avoided some huge headaches.""If some functionality on the car just isn't working out, we need to make that judgment call as soon as we can and stop wasting time getting it to work. ""We need to stop our habit of pulling numbers out of thin air, telling them to other people, and starting a massive number rumor mill. I think I heard twenty different numbers for rolling resistances for the same tire, varying over an order of magnitude. This makes it difficult to evaluate what our priorities are. We need to empirically test for these numbers, not make them up. If we do have to make numbers up, we should put our heads together and come up with 1 best guess, not twenty.""We need to get into a wind tunnel""When we get data, we need to pay attention to it.

Set a ship date for the car that's at least a few months before race day. Preferably a hard deadline, like Race to Vegas.

Set a ship date for the rolling chassis even earlier. Preferably a hard deadline, like a windtunnel appointment.

Go to a windtunnel. Preferably with scale models, definitely with the finished car.

Go on test drives, and make them as close as possible to race days. Strategy should predict power consumption and power production beforehand, then measure during the drive.

Make sure that telemetry is easy to use. Any engineer on the team should be able to get data from the car.

Make sure that the electrical system is simple and easy to debug. Boards should be independently testable, with or without the BPS.

Make sure that the mechanical system is simple. All of the top cars at WSC2011 were incredibly light (~140kg) and had simple mech systems.

Bring backups. Get as close as possible to straight up bringing two cars.

Don't build stuff unless it increases power production or reduces power consumption. At one point, Xenith had a driver controls design with a see-through Borg display and an iPod adapter. It then went on to consume 1500+ watts at 90kph.
