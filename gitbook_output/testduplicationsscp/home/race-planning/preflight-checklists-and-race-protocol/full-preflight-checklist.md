### Control stops

At a control stop, verify the same things as above. Time is fairly limited. Based on past experience, the most important things to check are:

* Solar car radio (make sure the batteries are full!)TiresArray connectors
* Solar car radio (make sure the batteries are full!)
* Tires
* Array connectors
* Solar car radio (make sure the batteries are full!)
* Tires
* Array connectors

Solar car radio (make sure the batteries are full!)

Tires

Array connectors

Before a control stop, trailer should drive ahead.

* Check for sharp stuff, use tarps if necessary.Prepare array stand, if necessary.
* Check for sharp stuff, use tarps if necessary.
