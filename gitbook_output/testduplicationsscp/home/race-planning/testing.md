## Testing

* Could we get 5000 klicks on the odometer before WSC 2013? How can we expect the car to finish a 3000 kilometer race without breaking down if it has never driven >3000 kilometers before.What if we said that anyone who wants to have free food and accommodations during the race has to go on 5 or 7 test driving weekends during the summer before.Go to interesting places for test drives. Las Vegas, Oregon, Utah, a windtunnel in the south or the midwest.We need to test the team as well as the car.  Full race testing is boring for just about everyone if everything works--and everything will work only if the whole team goes out and simulates races.  This means multi-day, scheduled so that everyone gets off work.  A three day weekend is probably not enough, unfortunately.Don't plan to do anything but drive in Australia, and plan to drive a lot.Here is the link to the testing log for this summer. Please fill out all fields whenever you take the car for a test drive:spreadsheet&#x20;
