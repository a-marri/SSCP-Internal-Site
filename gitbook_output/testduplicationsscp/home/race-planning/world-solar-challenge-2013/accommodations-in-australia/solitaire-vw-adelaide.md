## Solitaire VW Adelaide

In 2011 and 2013 the team used the garage space at Solidaire VW in Mile End (Adelaide) to do prep work on the car and the caravan. They have a full service shop, so they can even do wheel alignments for the solar car for you. The staff are friendly and helpful. Both years we timed our arrival in Adelaide so we showed up at Solitaire in the afternoon on a Friday and received keys to the building for the Saturday/Sunday weekend. In 2011 we used their reception bay. In 2013 we worked in their new empty warehouse next door. By 2015 the warehouse next door should be a VW service center as well.

Showing up to work over a weekend works well since Solitaire will be closed, so you won't be much of a burden for their staff. Make sure you overlap your stay with one working day, so the Solitaire staff can do a wheel alignment for you.

In 2013 we ended up spending four days at Solitaire VW working on the trailer and the car. They have a new, unused warehouse that we worked in. They inspired us to buy a bead blaster (bead booster) which makes it a breeze to install Michelins. They also helped us do a wheel alignment test with their Bosch machine.&#x20;

Craig Weber is the person to talk to. He is the director (or something like that) of the Solitaire VW center in Adelaide. He is friendly, and his daughter enjoyed sitting in the solar car. Usually we buy him a gift card (\~200AUD) to a nice restaurant in Adelaide.
