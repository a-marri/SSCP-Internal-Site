# Virgin Australia and Virgin Atlantic

Virgin is the best. Be sure to keep this relationship up.

* Brooke Anderson (in the Stanford SoE Corporate Communications office) originally introduced our team to David Addison in Virgin Atlantic. David Addison introduced our team to David White in Virgin Australia. David White and Virgin Australia provided the official sponsorship for our team. David White | Manager, Sustainability and Climate ChangePO Box 1034 Spring Hill QLD Australia 4004P 07 3295 3174 | M 0434 077 616E david.white@virginaustralia.comThe car was flown on a Virgin Atlantic 777 from LAX to MELDedola Global Logistics was the agent for customs paperworkMake sure you talk with your air line to make sure they fully understand your expectations with shipping the car in a crate. In 2013, Virgin initially told us that we could put our car in a wooden crate with equipment. Then they backtracked and said we couldn't put extra equipment in the crate. Then they backtracked again and said that we couldn't put the car in a crate since the extra weight of the crate was an occupational safety hazard by their standards. We ended up having to ship the car with bubble wrap as the only protection.If you can air ship the next car in a crate that would be great, but I would guess that your next airline will not want to ship the car in a crate. They may also charge you a lot more if the car is in a crate. I would recommend that you have a clear conversation with your shipping company about the requirements involved with air shipping the car in a crate (weight of crate, size of crate, pictures of 2013 crate, etc.) so they understand what you are trying to ship.I felt pretty uncomfortable air shipping the car without a wooden crate, but things turned out just fine. Remember that most of the cars that people would actually air ship are race cars and high value collectors cars. Airlines are used to treating cars especially well since most of the cars they ship are probably worth $100,000+ or millions.Even if you do not air ship the car in a wooden crate you definitely want to ship the car in a sturdy wooden crate if you ocean ship the car back to the US. Reach stackers with a skilled driver can whip massive shipping containers around terrifyingly fast. In 2011 a few of the wooden support beams that held the Xenith crate in place snapped and most of our loosely packed equipment was strewn throughout the container after the reach stackers had finished moving our container around. Pack your container securely.
