First of all, shipping the car via AIR Freight, inside of a wood crate I believe would be cost prohibitive. If that is still something that you are interested in I will definitely get some numbers for you. But I was assuming that that wouldn't even be a realistic option for you - especially since you have plenty of time.

-20' Container Load Rate from Palo Alto to Melbourne would be approx: $3,499.00  w/ bringing the container to your loading dock at Stanford.

-We can provide loading assistance as well, our rates are typically $45/man/hour with a 4 hour minimum. Our guys are very well trained in how to load a container properly and could definitely assist you with that. To load this I would estimate it would require 3-4 men, about 4-6 hours (for all of the blocking, strapping, securing, etc etc).

-Sounds like you would potentially have a lot of the misc. Equipment packed? Any packaging costs would be determined on what exactly was required and material costs. I don't feel like I have a good enough idea right now to be able to quote you on that. But so you know, we provide custom crating/packaging solutions for companies all over this area - so we can pack any loose equipment if needed.

CARNET: Since your shipment will be going into Australia - typically it would be required that you pay duties/taxes upon entry (and re-entry when back in the USA). However we can complete a "Carnet" for you on the shipment and that would let you avoid paying any duties/taxes. It is like a physical passport that travels with the shipment and exempts the shipment from customs in the USA and Australia. Setting up a Carnet, along with the fees and Bond costs would probably run you in the $1000 range depending on what you declare as the value in the end.
