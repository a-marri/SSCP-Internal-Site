# SSCP - Shipping Crate

# Shipping Crate

The team originally made plans with Virgin to ship our car in a wooden crate. However, after the crate was built a senior manager with Virgin Atlantic decided that the crate was too heavy for their equipment handlers to safely move, so we ended up sending the car wrapped in bubble wrap. 

## Details on the car crate

* Our team will build a crate for the car from fumigated, heat treated, and/or engineered woodThe crate will have 6 sturdy caster wheels as Virgin Australia requestedOur team will deliver the crate from Stanford to LAXWe will need to know what day to deliver the car in crate to LAX for the vehicle to be in Melbourne and cleared from Customs by September 10-12.We originally planned to put equipment in the crate above the solar car, but Virgin said the equipment was too heavy. Therefore we ended up carrying the equipment as checked baggage on flights to Australia. The equipment was shipped back to the US by virgin as "Personal Effects." Tom was the guy at Virgin that rejected the plan to put equipment in the crate. We planned on sending 390kg of equipment.The ideal size of the box with the solar car alone would be 4.7m long by 2m wide by 1.5m tall.Any wooden crates that the team sends to Australia have to be ISPM15 certifiedSee Sunbad PDM-Works for the crate assemblyAt the 11th hour we ended up not shipping the car in the crate since the additional weight of the crate was a occupational health and safety hazard according to Virgin. We ended up wrapping the car in a ton of bubble wrap and we wrapped the fairings separately.
