## Traveling to Australia Fall 2013 Q\&A

#### Why should I go to Australia?

1. You will have spent two years designing, building, and perfecting our new car. WSC is the most competitive solar car event in the world, so going to Australia is the best way to culminate the team's building experience.
2. There are 40 teams from absolutely every corner of the globe at the World Solar Challenge, so you'll get to see how other teams solve the same engineering and race challenges you face. Wondering how teams in Chile build a solar car? Wondering if German solar cars are well suited to carry beer? Wondering what exactly is an American solar car semi? Come to Australia to find out!
3. Stanford Solar Car people are pretty awesome and they are even more awesome when no one has to worry about problem sets and finals. Spending a quarter with your friends traveling across the Outback (twice!) and throughout Asia will be a blast!
4. You will have no limit to the number of unbelievable stories that you can tell your friends, family, enemies, lovers, and coworkers that start with "When I went to drive a solar car across the f\*&?>#\* Australian Outback..." The Outback is a pretty crazy place, and adding multimillion dollar race cars only augments the adventure.
5. You get pictures!

#### What will the 5-7 weeks in Australia entail?  Since the race is early October, does that mean that the team goes to Australia in early September, or do you guys plan to stay a couple weeks after the race?

We'll probably be in Australia in early September. Our tentative schedule is to have some people arriving in Australia the week of September 9th to receive the car from customs. The date that our car passes customs can vary. Two years ago there were strikes that delayed our car. Two years before that there was a tsunami that delayed our car. We basically have to sit around for a week or two waiting to hear when our car will be pass customs. We will probably want the rest of the team to be in Australia by September 15th. During the time before we receive our car we can do some things like picking up our rental vehicles, but since all of our tools and supplies will be with the car stuck in customs we can't do a whole lot. Therefore the first few days in Australia are pretty relaxing. We spent our time at a hostel in Melbourne in 2011. We were a block from the downtown St. Kilda area and a block and a half from the beach. Melbourne is a pretty cool city, so we kept ourselves busy until the car came out of customs. We also visited some Stanford alumni in Melbourne.

Once we had the car we started to do prepwork for around two weeks. We spent some time turning our shipping crate into a trailer. We spent time getting things like radios set up. However, the majority of our time was spent finalizing the car itself before the race. We did some work in random parking lots in Melbourne, but we also got access to a real garage space at a VW dealership in Adelaide. During this two week period we slowly make our way from the south of Australia, through Adelaide (the finish line for the race), up the stewart highway (through the Outback and the actual race course itself going backwards) to Darwin on the northern coast (the starting point for the race). We did a bunch of test drives and mock race scenarios in the Outback in 2011. This year we plan to do more mock races in the US, but in 2011 our drives in the Outback where some of the first times we spent doing extended periods of test driving on the car. We would have to stop periodically to make changes and we would make extensive changes to the car during the nigh wherever we stopped on our way north. Some nights we camped. Some nights we stayed in hostels. (BTW, Australia and New Zealand have a really extensive network of hostels.

Once we made it to Darwin we spent maybe 5 or 7 days at the race track. The Hidden Valley Race track is the staging ground for the race itself. Each team gets a bay in the pit garages to work on their car. The teams go through static and dynamic safety checks/scrutineering as well as their qualifying hot laps. Ideally teams would have race ready cars before they even land in Australia, but there are often teams that are still doing build work on their cars when they are at the racetrack just days before the event. This year our team will do everything possible to have a race ready car well before we ship to Australia.

Once the race itself starts the event takes 4-6 days from start to finish. The race itself is the exciting part, but it always feels like it goes by the quickest.

At the finish of the race the team will spend a couple of days in Adelaide. The race organizers usually rent a bar for the night one night for all of the race teams to party together. Eventually we have to drive back to Melbourne or whatever city we ship our car to. The drive back is usually pretty leisurely and we often take the scenic route along the coast. Once we are back in Melbourne it takes a few days to reorganize all of our assets, pack them into the shipping container, and deliver everything back to the shipping company. We return our cars and then everyone is free to travel.

If we kept the same schedule as 2013 people would fly out of Melbourne on October 19th or so.

Remember that all of the dates are still flexible.
