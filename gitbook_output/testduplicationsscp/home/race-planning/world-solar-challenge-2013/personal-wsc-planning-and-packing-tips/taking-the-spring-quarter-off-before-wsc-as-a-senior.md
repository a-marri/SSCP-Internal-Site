## SSCP - Taking the Spring Quarter off before WSC as a Senior

## Taking the Spring Quarter off before WSC as a Senior

I know there are a few people on the team who are planning on taking the spring quarter off, so I wanted to give you all a heads up.

If you plan to file a Post Graduation Quarter Petition to stay in housing this spring the deadline is February 8th. If you plan to file a Termination of Occupancy to move off campus this spring with no fee the deadline is also February 8th.  If you aren't applying to graduate this spring you should probably still go to R\&DE portal in Axess, select Forms & Petitions, and choose "Other Policy Exemption Request." The housing assignments told me that you can explain your story there if you want to try to stay in on campus housing even though you are taking a leave of absence and not graduating in the spring.

Additionally, don't forget to submit a leave of absence form and your your commencement walkthrough petition (if you're a senior).

It wouldn't be a bad idea to meet with your Academic Advisor and/or your department advisors to check to make sure you haven't overlooked any forms or issues. My academic advisor was pretty supportive of my plan and had some important insight.

If you are not coming back to take classes after Australia, but you want to graduate after the trip then you should be aware of the Undergraduate Graduation Quarter Special Registration Status Petition. Stanford will want you to be registered as a student if you are going to Australia with the team, so you may have to defer your graduation like I am if you are a senior not planning to co-term.

Finally, you may need to ask your department to sponsor you to keep your email address enabled if you will be away from Stanford for an extended period of time.

This email is by no means inclusive of all possible situations, but hopefully it is helpful.
