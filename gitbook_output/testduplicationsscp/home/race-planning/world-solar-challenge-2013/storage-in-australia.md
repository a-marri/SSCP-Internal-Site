# SSCP - Storage in Australia

# Storage in Australia

In 2013 we stored some peoples' backpacking equipment and some bubble wrap in a National Storage facility in Port Melbourne. It was close to the port where we picked up our pallets. Also, it was close to a Bunnings in Port Melbourne.

Usually you can negotiate half off or free rent for the first month's rental rate. Since you will only be storing stuff for a month or a month and a half, a storage locker can end up being super cheap with the discounts you can negotiate.

We originally planned to store our ocean shipping crate wood in the storage locker, but the ocean shipped crates were heavily damaged by Australian customs. We ended up throwing out the old crates and buying new ones when we returned to Melbourne.

Renting storage lockers in Australia works just about the same as it does in the US, and you can rent a locker at the last minute if necessary. You could delegate this task to a newer member of the team.
