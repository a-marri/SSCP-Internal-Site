## Race Crew Checklists

Use checklists during the race. Otherwise you will forget something critical eventually. Don't think that your memory is good enough to remember every critical task every single time.&#x20;

Things to add to future checklists: check weather report. put traffic cone on road (WSC officials want a traffic cone ned to the road next to wherever you sleep for the night). Charge Satellite phones. Pack lunch for observer. Someone on road to flag car into check point. Clean the array at check point.
