# SSCP - Shipping the Car to Australia

# Shipping the Car to Australia

Here are some details on the car itself and our best guess on the size and weight of the crate it would need.

Solar Car: 71" wide, 177" long, 46" tall

Solar Car: 370lbs approximately

Crate: 7' wide, 16.5' long, 6' tall approximately

Crate, car, and all other contents: 2300 lbs a very rough estimate

Solar car value: $500,000 estimate

Total Shipment: $575,000 estimate (we may include additional race equipment with the solar car in its crate)

If we ship by ocean we would probably just put everything in a 20' cargo container. If we ship by air we would only ship by air to Australia, not back. We would ship by ocean from Australia back to the US regardless of how we get the car to Australia.Â

Assume your boat may be delayed a month. Teams have had delays that long. Would you be screwed if anything didn't show up to Australia? You can buy most things there, but if all of your Michelin tires are diverted to Indonesia because of a Typhoon you will be very sad. Bring a few tires on the plane.

Same goes with personal gear. Don't put all of your necessities on the boat unless you are willing to buy everything in Australia. Granted airlines can lose your bags as well.

Put crappy tires on the car at a moderate pressure instead of fully inflated Michelins.

Are you all flying and shipping to Melbourne, Adelaide, or a mix of the two? I was under the impression that everyone and everything was going to Adelaide. The email below suggested otherwise the way I read it. Just make sure you'll have the right vehicles and people to transport everything. If I'm confused others traveling to Australia may also be confused.

Why do you need to put the 4' by 4' by 7' crate in your rented trucks in Australia? I would plan on emptying the crate into your vehicles, so you can rearrange everything. It would be impossible or very difficult to access items in a crate that is inside a car. Australian import customs will probably destroy your crate (especially if you piss them off by using screws instead of nails) when they inspect the crate. Be ready to throw your US to Australia crates in a dumpster when you arrive in Australia if they are damaged. Be ready to buy new crates for the return trip to the US.

Also, be sure to document the state of your crates when you receive them. Don't rush to unload everything. Look for damage, document it, get the dock workers to acknowledge the damage, and make sure you have all of your ducks in a row in case you need to file a claim.

We would have been better off with two 4' x 4' x 4' crates going from the US to Australia if we had known that Virgin wouldn't air freight anything besides the car for us. On the Australia to US trip we probably filled two and a half 4' x 4' x 4' crates, though we paid for three full crates.

It will usually be cheaper to ocean ship equipment to Australia than to buy it in Australia. The exception would be perishables and bulky, cheap, commodities. I would take the Australia to US shipping lists from last year cross off anything that you both 1) know you do not have a duplicate in California for and 2) need for testing at the end of the summer. A lot of tools can go. You have duplicates. Spare car parts can go. Camping equipment can go.

Make sure you are talking to the right people at your air freight vendor about shipping the car in a crate or shipping the car with equipment.

* The business/sales/logistics or whoever they were people that we first talked to at Virgin also told us that we could definitely ship Luminos in a crate and have equipment in the crate. By the time we got down to the details and were actually talking with the people who would actually be putting the car on a plane at the airport the people who were the most informed told us that we absolutely could not put the car in a crate or ship additional equipment with the car. There were OSHA requirements in the US and super strong safety regulations in Australia.You should get a detailed signed quote that says you can ship the car in a crate with equipment. The document should be pretty detailed describing the size, materials, equipment, weight, crate design, lifting options, and everything else important involved. It is too easy for sales people eager to close a deal to naively promise things that their company cannot deliver. If you are talking to Schumacher rather than the airline directly you may have even more misinformation than we had. For Virgin their 777 (or whatever plane they used) didn't have a wide enough body for equipment to load the crate into the plane using a unit load device pallet. Get some drawings of the cargo bay, cargo door, and any other constraining geometry for the plane your vendor plans to use. Consider the geometry of your crate on a ULD and see if it sounds reasonable for that to fit through the cargo door of the plane you will be on, to rotate into position, and to slide down the cargo bay of the plane. Virgin had to roll our car into the plan by hand to get it to fit. Watch some youtube videos of large items and cars being loaded onto cargo planes so you get a sense of what is actually involved.Don't learn to put full trust in your vendors especially if you are asking them to do a strange or unique service for you. Schumacher seems to fit the bill for shipping a fragile multimillion dollar car internationally, but you should still ensure that you are very detailed and explicit in explaining what you are asking them to ship for you. Experienced as they may be in shipping collectors' cars, they may have never shipped a solar car.

Where will you put the crate while you are driving around Australia? You can rent a large car sized locker, but that would be expensive. Are you going to use the crate as your race trailer?

### Post 2011 Race Advice from Nathan

[](#h.aoe0swf8pcpo)

Generally, on international shipping, make sure you have a plan B and C for everything. Why it's so hard to get people to actually ship your stuff after having promised to do so, I have no clue. In 2009, there was a typhoon that delayed everything by at least a week. In 2011, there was a strike of customs workers that delayed the shipment by 1.5 weeks. Just be ready.

Take particular care with batteries. I might even pursue parallel processes with different shipping companies going in the event that one decides they don't want to ship your packs. Remember that some other teams have the wealth of nations (Lufthansa, KLM, DHL, etc) to push through battery shipping regs, so don't underestimate this.

Also, a window of hours to get batteries on a boat in LA? Read up on the proper literature first.

As far as tools go, I would use the excellent packing lists that the Luminos logistics team put together. If you're looking more for a strategy to decide what to pack, here are some of the hypotheticals I considered when packing for the 2011 race, from a car maintenance perspective (this assumes that you can buy virtually anything else in Australia):Â 

- Do you have the tools to swap every single component on the car?

- What happens if one suspension assembly is ripped off by a curb impact? Do you have enough parts, tools, and alignment and brake equipment to keep going?

- What happens if the car is involved in a minor collision?

- What if there's a composite structural failure?

- What happens if you need an Imperial bolt, tap, or die? What about if a critical thread is stripped?Â 

- What if there's a known but not well advertised single point of failure for every board on the car (*cough* Sasha *cough)?

- What happens if all of your good soldering irons are destroyed (or won't turn on) with a shitty car inverter?

- What happens when your air compressor is accidentally plugged into 240V on day 2 of the race?

- What if the canopy is hit and snapped by a kangaroo!?

I won't say which of these are real - 60% of them are. While I'm on the subject, let's talk a bit about ways that shipping can go wrong:

- (Principia?) having their shipping crate collapse on them while ocean freighting, destroying some number of modules.

- UNSW flipping their trailer on the way north, destroying their beautiful car covered in PERL cells.

- Corrosion on connectors left exposed to air (I forget which team this was in '11)

- Batteries blocked in transit (batteries got stuck in Singapore due to air freight regs)

- Salt-air corrosion of aluminum on Michigan's cars, causing terrifying failures of motor rims in the last year. Ask your favorite Michigan contact about why coatings on aluminum are way more important than you might think.

- There was definitely at least one team in 2011 that couldn't enter Australia due to visa issues.

- Any more that you guys remember?

Anyways, I need to head to bed. Happy shipping!
