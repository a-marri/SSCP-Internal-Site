Race Crew Team Objectives

Here is a list of objectives that you all should work towards between now and our first test weekend/mock race at the end of the quarter. 

* Meet with all of the members of the team (or send them an email) who went to WSC last fall.Create a list of every action that members did during the previous race. For example...booking campsites in the middle of the Outback during the racepitching tentsswapping tiresfinding places to stop for the nightarranging to get Xenith through scrutinizing at Darwinetc.Start to develop the race planning pages on the Google Site: https://sites.google.com/site/susolarcar/home/race-planning. This would be a good place to keep the checklists because anyone on the team who raced last year can edit those lists to add missing steps.That list will be pretty long, but it is an important starting place.Organize that list into categories and into the three major phases of our trip in Australia (Pre-race testing, pre-race prep at Darwin International Raceway, in-race events).Define reasonable roles for members during the race. For example

* Once you have solid drafts of the checklists you all will be responsible for training new members on how to execute whatever roles (member can swap roles from race day to race day so things don't get boring) they plan to do during the race in Australia or mock races before that. If would also be nifty if you could create a smartphone app that would allow everyone on the team to keep their checklists with them at all times. Last fall we ended up stuck on the side of the road for two and a half hours because we forgot to properly engage our motor in a pin that restrains the motor. The motor ripped itself apart and we dropped form 5th place to 17th place while we were on the side of the road repairing the motor. The goal of this team is to prevent these exact types of catastrophic mistakes and to make sure that races go as smoothly as possible.

 Some deadlines

* Would you all please try to meet with all of the members of our team who went to Australia last year before March 3rd. There are 21 members who went to the race (some of them have graduated, so you'll have to email them). Please get a preliminary list of tasks that they did during the race last year.If they have time you can record details about how they executed those tasks, or you can follow up with them in the weeks before March 17th. Let's try to have a set of checklists available for the core in-race events so that we can review them during finals week and we can start assigning roles before we leave for our mock race and test weekend on the 23rd.Wyles may have more things to add to this checklist and the roles and responsibilities of this team will probably evolve and expand over time.
