# SSCP - Composite Chassis Analysis

# Composite Chassis Analysis

The attached document details how to complete a full FEA analysis of a solar car, including the steel roll cage, composite aerobody, and honeycomb sandwich panels.  There are many ways to do this kind of analysis, this documents 1 way.  The results of this analysis have never been verified through testing nor have they been submitted to any scrutineering body for approval for any competition, so I cannot guarantee the acceptance of the results.  This analysis cannot be done without full definition of your material properties, which you definitely don't get from manufacturer data sheets; empirical testing data is necessary to validate your analysis.
