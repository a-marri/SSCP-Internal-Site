## Sherlock Super Cluster

This is the first cycle that the team has gotten access to the Sherlock HPC (High performance Computing) Cluster. We intend to use this cluster to run CFD on our meshes. This page contains good practices and useful commands that we have acquired over time

1. Open a terminal app and type ssh @sherlock.stanford.edu eg. ssh maisam@sherlock.stanford.edu
2. Enter your SUNET password and enable access with your 2-step device
