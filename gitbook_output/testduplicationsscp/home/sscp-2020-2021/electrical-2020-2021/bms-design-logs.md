This is the beginning of Maisam's and Simon's design logs & mostly random thoughts on the BMS. We will resist the temptation to overly emphasize our frustrations here - We have a slack channel for that.

Decided BMS this cycle was going to be built in individual parts and jigsawed together over time. We will test all the sub components in isolation, try to break them and then make them better. Then slowly integrate it and have the BMS we know and love ready. Our plan of attack is highlighted on the sheet.

Planning to meet with Sarah W. to ask a bunch of questions before we start building test suites and such.
