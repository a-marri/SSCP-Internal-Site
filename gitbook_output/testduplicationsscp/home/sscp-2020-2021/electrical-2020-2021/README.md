As a sub-team, we are in charge of all of the electrical systems in the car, which means everything from the motors to the vehicle computer to the circuit boards which utilize the power provided by the solar array. 

New to the team? 

Awesome! We are excited to have you. Before you can get work on one of the big projects, you will need to get up to speed on some of our tools. See the link below for our recommended sequence of activities/small projects to complete in order to get yourself up to speed on circuit design, Altium, LT Spice, and soldering. You will find that there are extensive resources under links on this page to help you get up to speed. See the subpage listing above.
