# Purpose of the Electrical System

Introduction

A solar car is just a pinewood derby car without an electrical system. It stores energy in batteries, protects those batteries from damage, listens to the driver's commands, delivers energy to the motor, harvests energy from the solar panels, and provides useful information to both the driver and the rest of the team.
