Notes:

If you want to learn more about solar car without reading, watch this video:

As you contact sponsors, in my example I said "we feature our sponsors on social media", this was kind of a blanket statement since we were contacting sponsors last minute for things that were not critical to the car.  As we begin emailing people, it is important to know the sponsor levels outlined in our sponsorship packet here:

[http://solarcar.stanford.edu/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/SSCP-Sponsor-Info-Brochure.pdf](http://solarcar.stanford.edu/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/SSCP-Sponsor-Info-Brochure.pdf)

This cycle the tier breakdown will probably be very similar, except we treat donations under $2k as "fans".  Essentially, below $2,000 donations we would do something like a social media post and over that amount, they would be at a bronze level and start getting logos on things.

I say this now so that when you email sponsors, you should say something along the lines of "Our sponsors (depending on level of sponsorship) get access to perks such as logo placement on our vehicle and trailer, recruiting access to our student engineers, & brand exposure through our social media." - and add that you can send them the sponsorship packet if you are interested, as opposed to just telling them they get social media features like I did in my example emails.
