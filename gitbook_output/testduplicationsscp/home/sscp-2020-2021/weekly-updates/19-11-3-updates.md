What can you do now?

* Learn Solidworks - requirement for all Mech and battery team members
* Learn Ansys FEA - optional for those interested in modeling the suspension loads for Black Mamba and new car
* Read the Leading Edge - requirement for all Aero team members
* SPONSORSHIP - everyone is required to attend Courtney's Cold Email Seminar and try the method on at least 5 companies before the start of the new year - Seminar will be held at a later date during one of our meetings, TBDbrainstorm companies now, definitely leverage any personal connections

Let's tour the shop??

We'll see you Sunday at 1:00 pm!

Hang around if you want to model sponsored items.

Action items:

New members - do on-boarding things, think about what subteams you would like to work on, read rules, tell your friends.

Courtney - add ppl to drive/site/slack, get something together for sponsorship seminar, do chassis analysis.

Returning members - read rules, get started on either ASC documentation, sponsorship, or subetam projects.  Think of projects for new members.
