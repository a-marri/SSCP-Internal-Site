# General Design Principles

This is a place for thoughts that don't fall under one of the other categories and issues that apply to everyone. However, a topic actually applies to everyone it may be better to paste the thought in each team's sub-page so that they notice the comment.

* "Good design is as little design as possible." - Dieter Rams
* "Without data you are just another person with an opinion" - W. Edwards Demingaka. Have hard numbers that support why you're designing your project the way you are!
* aka. Have hard numbers that support why you're designing your project the way you are!
* "As a general design guideline, I think we should go for a fairly simple design that is very well thought out functionality-from all angles, and has simple, efficient solutions to problems. While it may not be as "flashy" of an approach as Xenith, it would lead to a more successful car. For example: Tokai's rear wheel steering control was a five-way switch. It did exactly what it needed to but nothing more."
* "We need to consider accessibility and ease of use/repair. Had the rear wheel been easier to get to, we probably could have avoided our epic fail. "
* "If was design for larger tolerances, our car will better tolerate changes later in the game. In a process like ours, design changes are always happening, we need to be ready for them."
* "We should consistently check the actual car back to the CAD. Finding out that the rear is riding three inches high two days before the race is easily avoidable."
* Testing is part of making a car, not a nice add-on.  We cannot make claims about how the car will perform until it has been proven to perform that well during testing.
* Remember that integration bugs always come up.  As Nathan Golshan said, we had a collective attitude of "My shit works.  Why doesn't yours?"  That was partly a joke, but it was harmful in the end.  One part working in isolation doesn't mean that it is guaranteed to work on the car, which means that we need to finish individual projects way earlier so we have time to work out integration bugs.
* Documentation matters.  Design documents before starting projects are important because they force you to bring decisions out into the open: which tires are we using?  What general algorithm will this run, and why was that picked?  What tradeoffs are there, and which side did we pick?  Documentation during a project: I was working and I found that this approach failed.  That's why this piece looks a certain way.  And after a project is done, documentation includes a readme of some sort and a clear explanation of what the project was and how to use the result.
