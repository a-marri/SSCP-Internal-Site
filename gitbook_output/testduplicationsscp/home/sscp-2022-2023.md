# SSCP 2022-2023

The end of 2021 through 2024 has been a period of rebuilding the team. Given an irresponsible team history, faculty advisor challenges, and multiple threats to shut down the team,Â  we had MANY challenges gaining access to our workspace and getting any work done on the current or any future vehicles. But we keep going!

Most documentation from this period is in the shared Google Drive.
