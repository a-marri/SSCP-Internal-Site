# SSCP - Stuff to do this week

# Stuff to do this week

Look at the individual projects page for details of the projects I'm referencing here.

New people are defined to be people who haven't programmed on solar car before.  Hi!  We're happy to have you.

Everyone else should have at least programmed a board or two, and you're read y to jump into these projects.  I'll be asking you next Saturday what your status is for these.

--I gave two of you auto-cancelling turn signals.  Three new people showed up--you can grab one of them and have them work with you.  You just need a driver controls board.

--One person and a new person should work on the kent display board.  The board is in the new programming project box.

--Two more people and a new person should start on brake light fading.

--To get an idea of I2C specs, look up the datasheet for the LMV 1089 and read through the communications stuff.

When you pick a project, email me to say the names of the people working on it and any questions you have.

I'll try to update this every week with new instructions, so you can always check this page to know what I want you to do.  These projects will be your primary work for the rest of the quarter, probably.  I'll expect you to just come in and start working on them at meetings.
