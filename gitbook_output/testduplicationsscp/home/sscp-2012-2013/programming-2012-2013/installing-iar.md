### Installing ST-Link Drivers

Go to this website, go to the "Design Resources" tab, and scroll down to the "SW Drivers" section and download the ST-Link USB driver.  Install it.

[this website](http://www.st.com/internet/evalboard/product/251168.jsp)

If that didn't work try downloading the ST-Link utility from the same page and install that.  It should install drivers as part of its installation.
