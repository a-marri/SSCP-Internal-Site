## Programming Fundamentals and Planning

(Especially for electrical/code projects) Always keep a working copy of the project and write new code/test new hacks on a different copy.  That way a gamble or an attempt to implement the next feature doesn't stop the whole car from running. This is in fact what Git is for - you can create branches, each of which represents a single sub-project / idea you're working on, and merge them back into the master branch when you're sure your changes work.
