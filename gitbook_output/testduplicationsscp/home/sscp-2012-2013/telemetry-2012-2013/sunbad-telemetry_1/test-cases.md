# SSCP - Test cases

# Test cases

Only check things off if the functionality has been tested.  It's not enough to have some sort of untested code there to deal with a problem.

Add a check if your part of the code supports the listed item.  Sort by your part to see what you still need to do.  Add descriptions of more test cases if you can think of other things that need to be tested.  Email if something isn't clear.
