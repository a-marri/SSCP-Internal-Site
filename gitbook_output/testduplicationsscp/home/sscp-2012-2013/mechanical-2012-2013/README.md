Critical Mechanical Systems:

These are systems which, if they were to fail, would risk injury or death to the driver of the solar car. Every significant part of each of these systems must be analysed to ensure road fitness. The primary responsibility of the mechanical team is to know that the below systems will not fail. The regulations demand this.
