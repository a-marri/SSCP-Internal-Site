Bill of Materials

\[USE THIS SPACE TO MAKE A LIST OF ALL THE COMPONENTS IN YOUR ASSEMBLY. THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT FOR MAKING SURE THAT EVERY PART OF YOUR ASSEMBLY HAS BEEN ORDERED. IT'S ALSO KEY TO MAKE SURE THAT ALL REPLACEMENT PARTS ARE READY FOR THE RACE. EXAMPLE COMPONENTS HAVE BEEN FILLED IN FOR YOU]

Conclusions

\[WHAT WORKED, WHAT DIDN'T. FILL THIS IN AFTER LOTS OF TESTING OR A RACE]
