# Wheel Cover Testing 2014

Summary of the wheel cover testing process at the beginning of the 2014-2015 build cycle.

Purpose:

This project is meant to explore the aerodynamic benefits and/or disadvantages of installing a close-fitting cover/skirt around the car's tires. Based on recommendations from other teams, we believe that adding this feature may reduce rolling resistance due to viscous shear stress at the tire surface. Our goal is to build basic wheel cover prototypes which will be “installed” on Luminos using a test stand, and get experimental power draw data from the car's motors which can be compared to the power draw without wheel covers.

This project was used as an onboarding project for new members who joined at the beginning of the 2014-2015 cycle.
