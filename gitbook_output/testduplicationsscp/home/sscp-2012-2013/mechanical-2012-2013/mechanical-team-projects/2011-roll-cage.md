Here are details from Matt:

A little bit of background: titanium is awesome.  It comes in three flavors: Grade 1, which is just pure titanium, and not actually that strong.  Grade 5 is the strongest alloy, but you can't get seamless tube in Grade 5 (part of why it took me so long to source the tube).  Grade 9 is the second strongest alloy, and you can get seamless tube in Grade 9.

The tubes were 1" outer diameter, 0.088" wall thickness (0.824" inner diameter).  More specifically, they were Grade 9 Seamless Titanium Tubes.

I originally ordered 13 feet, but I placed a second order for 8 feet because the bending shop wanted some extra in case the bends didn't work.

I got the tubes from Marty at SR Sales in Texas.  He gave us a good price, but it wasn't sponsored.  His name was on the Michigan website, so they might have gotten it sponsored through him.  His email is marty@srsalesco.com and his phone number is +18179266576.

The tubes were bent by SF Tube, who Zika introduced me to.  My contact there was Jean Legault, Vice President, and they did a great job.  I think the lead time was a few weeks, because they have a big shop and had to wait for a break in their work to bend the tubes (because they were doing it for free).  I sent them a pdf drawing and STEP file for the roll cage (included), and they made a dwg layout drawing.  I just noticed that their layout drawing says that my bend table had a lot of errors.  Bending is the easiest thing to screw up, so whoever designs the roll cage should create a STEP file, bend table, and drawing to provide to the bender, cutter, and welder.  They have CNC tube benders, and even though they asked me to get more titanium, they didn't end up using the extra.  I think it's somewhere in the shop.  Here's his contact info:

I had a guy named Matt Lambert cut the tubes after they were bent.  Sasha's godfather, Zika, has a shop that does tubular construction (welding, mitering and maching), but they didn't have tooling that could do titanium, so I cut the tubes on the PRL cold saw (which I broke). I mitered (fishmouthed) the tubes on the Matsuura using a 1" carbide endmill (which Greg dropped and broke, then bought a new one).

Al at Arc Fusion welded the tubes, and did a great job.  Zika introduced me to Al, who does jobs for him sometimes.  I had two very similar parts in the design, and didn't do a good job in the weldment drawing at calling out the difference, so he swapped them, but we we able to fix the problem with the grinder.  He did a great job, and was very quick, I think only a few days.  In fact, he was so quick that I had Nathan Hall-Snyder go to his shop to pick up the frame because he finished it on a weekend that I was out of town.  Al welded the roll bars for free.

Wes-co didn't end up welding the frame.  Zika at Wes-co is Sasha's godfather, and he put me in touch with the bender and welder.  Wes-co was going to cut the tubes, but they ended up not having the right tooling.

Everything was sponsored except the titanium tubes, which probably could be sponsored or gotten for cheaper.  I got 13 feet for about $800.  The only downside to getting the bending sponsored was that the lead time was pretty long (about a month), but I think this might be true for any small job at a big bending shop.

I wasn't involved with the plate, I think NHS got it off Ebay.  I think it's pretty easy to source.

I can add more detail to the Google Site if necessary.

1" OD is a bit smaller than I originally planned for, but 0.88" is a thick wall thickness, so they are stout tubes.
