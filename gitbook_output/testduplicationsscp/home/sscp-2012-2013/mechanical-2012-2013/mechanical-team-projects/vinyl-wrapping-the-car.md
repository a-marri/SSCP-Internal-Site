# SSCP - Vinyl Wrapping the Car

# Vinyl Wrapping the Car

In 2013, the team decided to vinyl wrap Luminos. Here are the benefits and costs of using vinyl over paint:

### Benefits

* Material is free since 3M donates it. High quality automotive paint can cost thousands of dollarsThe team can theoretically vinyl wrap the car or parts of the car ourselves if there is someone who is especially careful and patient in their craftsmanship (If you can get professionals to do it for you don't try to do it yourself).Vinyl wil save many kilos of weight compared to paintThe team will lose the car for a shorter period of time while waiting on vinyl wrapping compared to paintingIf the team uses printed vinyl graphics or cuts the vinyl carefully it is possible to have much more intricate vehicle graphics

## Strategies for applying vinyl

[](#h.yzqhtdvapwct)

* Step 1: Don't vinyl wrap your car yourself if you don't need to. Elite Auto Films and Yak Graphics have expressed an interest in vinyl wrapping our car in the past. However, if you have someone on the team who is willing to spend a solid two weeks doing an incredibly thorough job of vinyl wrapping you could get better results vinyl wrapping yourself rather than using professionals. Elite Auto Films didn't create butted seams for us on the fairings that they wrapped for us in 2013.Step 2: If you do have to vinyl wrap the car yourselves try to get as much experience applying vinyl as possible. In 2013, Wesley vinyl wrapped the 4 wheels of his car and parts of the exterior body panels of his own car before vinyl wrapping luminos. Aside: It turns out that vinyl kind of sucks for wrapping wheels in the long term unless you are willing to use many pieces of vinyl creating many seams. If you try to use just one continuous piece of vinyl to wrap the front of your wheels it will peel off over time. However, attempting to wrap wheels with vinyl does teach you the limits of stretching vinyl, so the exercise has some utility.Successfully wrapping the car requires a lot of hands on experience. The technique tips below will help avoid long term problems with the vinyl, but odds are that the vinyl will come out with a lot of wrinkles if you try to dive in the deep end and wrap the car as the team's first vinyl project.Watch some videos online to get a visual sense for productive vinyl wrapping techniques:Start with the older How-To videos archived on the Avery YouTube channel. http://www.youtube.com/user/AveryDennisonVideoSpend an evening searching for derivatives of "How to vinyl wrap*". There are a lot of noobs trying to make informative videos, so you'll have to closely look for the good ones.

## Solar Car Specific Technique Tips

* Remember that every surface imperfection in your Bondo will print through your vinyl. The only exception is holes that are smaller than 0.25" or so. Bumps, dust, surfaces that are not curvature continuous will definitely show up. You also need to remember that pre-vinyl wrapped carbon masks a lot of the surface imperfections that will be clearly visible in the final vinyl. It is difficult to identify a small defect in a camouflaging sea of Bondo, Surface Master, carbon, and glue.Be especially diligent with your Bondo work and sanding before you even think about vinyl. If you can feel surface roughness you will have a problem. If you can see surface roughness before you start to vinyl wrap the aero team will take you behind a shed. Once you are certain that you have done a good Bondo job, the best way to prove yourself wrong is to pre-wrap sections of the car that are liable to be problematic. Large expanses of flat Surface Master with no foaming adhesive between the carbon and Surface Master will likely be okay. However, the regions near the zones that you needed to do Bondo work on will probably need to be checked. To check the surface first wipe down the surface with IPA. Then cut generously sized rectangles of vinyl and apply them to the car. If the vinyl surface looks fine, you are good to go. If there are imperfections then pull out the sanders and Bondo for another week of manual labor. Also, if you find it tricky to apply large-ish sized rectangles of vinyl now you will have a tough time applying huge sheets of vinyl. Move the car to a clean room (e.g. the Seminar Room) before you start wrapping the car.Spray off large dust particles with compressed air. If you only try to wipe them off with a solvent you will just spread them around instead of removing them.Clean the car with a solvent every time you bring it out of the mech room to continue vinyl wrapping. IPA doesn't appear to adversely affect the vinyl. Avoid getting acetone or MEK on the vinyl unless you know it won't cause short term or long term issues.Be careful around sections of the carbon that have foaming adhesive between the carbon and the Surface Master. Using foaming adhesive as a filler next to array wiring channels or other sharp corners allows you to avoid the need to diligently stuff carbon into these curves, but the Surface Master loves to flake off when it is attached to foaming adhesive instead of flat carbon. The holes left behind when the Surface Master flakes generally won't print through into the vinyl, but if you get Surface Master dust on the vinyl the dust will show up. Remember that positive defects on your surface show up a lot more than negative defects. You are most likely to flake off Surface Master if you allow a sheet of vinyl to tack down to the car and then you try to reposition the vinyl. Make sure you don't let the vinyl tack in to the wrong place if there is Surface Master on foaming adhesive. Pre-wrapping sections of Surface Master with foaming adhesive and then ripping off the vinyl may tear off most of the Surface Master that is likely to flake off, but it doesn't eliminate the issueTry to do your vinyl wrapping on a warm day. If temperatures are close to freezing you can actually rip/shatter the vinyl when you try to stretch it. The hotter the temperatures the more the vinyl will stretch even without heat guns.You will want a team of at least two to apply the vinyl. One person will be manning the squeegee. One person will be pulling the vinyl taught. If you have a third person they can manage the heat gun. One person wrapping alone takes 3 times as long as two people working together.The person who helps to stretch will need to put uniform tension on the vinyl to help prevent wrinkles. The best way to do this is to wrap the end of the vinyl around a rigid metal rod and pull on the rod. If you try to grab the vinyl without a rod to distribute the force you will distort the vinyl and start wrinkles.Make sure everyone that touches the vinyl or the car surface wears gloves. Skin oils significantly reduce the vinyl's tackinessOnce you have squeegees out and you are applying the vinyl note that the felt covered side of vinyl squeegees doesn't leave as many scratches as the bare silicone side. However, the bare silicone side does a better job of dissipating wrinkles that are about to form. If you are wrapping and you notice that wrinkles are starting to bunch up in the vinyl you need to have your partner pull the vinyl taught. Heat that section with the wrinkles and they will hopefully disappear. If they don't then use the silicone side of the squeegee to press out the wrinkles while the vinyl is still hot.Keep the vinyl warm/hot while you are applying it.You don't need to apply a ton of heat and tension when you are applying the vinyl to flat surfaces, but it helps when you are applying to curved surfaces. If the vinyl isn't hot/malleable enough when you apply it there will be too much tension in the vinyl and it will be liable to peel off months later.It is easy to burn through the vinyl with the heat gun. Hair dryers are too cold. The cool setting on the black heat gun at VAIL is less likely to melt through the vinyl, but it will make your job slow. Use the low setting at first and then when you are comfortable you can use the high setting. Melting a hole through the vinyl after spending 50 minutes on one piece sucks, so always play it safe. It is possible to use your hand near the vinyl as a way to gauge how much heat you are putting into the vinyl. If you hand feels like it burns you've put enough heat in to stretch the vinyl. The vinyl can likely take more heat without tearing, but at least you have one data point. Once the vinyl starts to tear you will have a 1" diameter hole before you can turn the heat away. You can't just patch it. Start over with a new sheet of vinyl.The larger the vinyl sheets are that you use the fewer seams you will have, but large sheets are unwieldily and can lead to large failed investments if you rip a hole part way through. Luminos had 4' wide vinyl sheets on the flat underbelly and used 12-24" wide strips along the sidewall of the car. Avoid seams that are perpendicular to the air flow. If you find it difficult to tack down the vinyl in some curved surfaces you are probably trying to stretch the vinyl too much. Pick a different seam scheme to avoid stretching the vinyl to more than 150% of the original length. If you really need to get the vinyl to stick better or if you are trying to get the vinyl to stick to rough surfaces like carbon you can use 3M Vinyl Primer. Use two layers and let the primer dry 5-10 minutes between layers.The vinyl is likely to peel at its edges, so use 3M Vinyl Edge Sealer to secure the edges of the vinyl. This can be painted on in places where you don't care about the surface quality (e.g. where the vinyl wraps into the fairings and under the array). Note that the solvent in the vinyl edge sealer appears to dissolve the vinyl's original adhesive before the edge sealer itself cures. Therefore the vinyl may peel up quickly where you apply vinyl edge sealer if the vinyl is under a lot of tension. Just make sure someone keeps an eye on your edges while the edge sealer dries.When it comes time to seal the edges of your vinyl between multiple pieces of vinyl, the best technique the team found in 2013 was to use a large syringe (or eyedropper if necessary) to force edge sealer between the vinyl seam. Then use a soft Silicone squeegee to wipe up the excess edge sealer. The team used a 1"^2 square of the greg solar module silicone laminator diaphragm as a squeegee. They cut a tapered edge to give the silicone a sharp edge. If you curve the squeegee into a U shape and drag the silicone along the seam the excess edge sealer will pool into a blob along the base of the U. This will allow excess edge sealer to flow into places that you applied insufficient edge sealer, and it will also ensure that the width of the edge sealer overlap is uniform and pretty. The team used 3 coatings of edge sealer in 2013 in places where they used the squeegee technique since the silicone removed the majority of the edge sealer.If you remove all of the release film on a sheet of vinyl the vinyl will become unwieldily. The exposed adhesive will stick to itself and eventually the sheet will crumple into a wadded mess. Leave the majority of the release film while you work and only remove 1ft at a time. You want enough vinyl so that you have a section that you can stretch to work around curves, but you don't want so much that the vinyl sticks to itself. If the vinyl's adhesive does stick to itself you will want to warm the vinyl before you pull it apart. If you rip the vinyl apart you will occasionally tear holes in the vinyl in places where the adhesive was stronger than the vinyl itself. Warming the vinyl seems to help.If you lay down a section of vinyl and notice that there is dust below the vinyl you can lift the vinyl off and use tweezers to remove the dust. However, you run the risk of the vinyl lifting off flakes of Surface Master if you try to lift off the vinyl.Making nice butted seams is kind of tricky. In 2013 the team started by laying down one piece of vinyl. Then we used a straight edge to define straight edges. You can also use masking tape to define straight or curved lines that you intend to cut. We cut the vinyl along our guide leaving an exposed vinyl edge. Next we wrapped a second sheet with excess material extending over the original vinyl piece. Using the non-fuzzy side of a squeegee we pressed the second piece of vinyl firmly into the notch created by the exposed edge of the first piece of vinyl. Then we cut the second piece of vinyl as carefully as possible along the visible notch. You will have to experiment on a separate pair of vinyl sheets before starting to determine where on the notch you need to cut to get perfectly butted seams. If you cut too high the pieces will overlap. if you cut too low you will leave a gap.If you do accidentally leave unsightly gaps it helps to use a permanent marker to recolor the exposed Surface Master below before you seal the seam with edge sealer. If you are cutting curved lines make sure you step back and ensure that your masking tape guide looks good before you take the razor blades out.

It is possible to use your hand near the vinyl as a way to gauge how much heat you are putting into the vinyl. If you hand feels like it burns you've put enough heat in to stretch the vinyl. The vinyl can likely take more heat without tearing, but at least you have one data point. Once the vinyl starts to tear you will have a 1" diameter hole before you can turn the heat away. You can't just patch it. Start over with a new sheet of vinyl.
* You don't need to apply a ton of heat and tension when you are applying the vinyl to flat surfaces, but it helps when you are applying to curved surfaces. If the vinyl isn't hot/malleable enough when you apply it there will be too much tension in the vinyl and it will be liable to peel off months later.

* The larger the vinyl sheets are that you use the fewer seams you will have, but large sheets are unwieldily and can lead to large failed investments if you rip a hole part way through. Luminos had 4' wide vinyl sheets on the flat underbelly and used 12-24" wide strips along the sidewall of the car. Avoid seams that are perpendicular to the air flow. 
* If you find it difficult to tack down the vinyl in some curved surfaces you are probably trying to stretch the vinyl too much. Pick a different seam scheme to avoid stretching the vinyl to more than 150% of the original length. If you really need to get the vinyl to stick better or if you are trying to get the vinyl to stick to rough surfaces like carbon you can use 3M Vinyl Primer. Use two layers and let the primer dry 5-10 minutes between layers.
* The vinyl is likely to peel at its edges, so use 3M Vinyl Edge Sealer to secure the edges of the vinyl. This can be painted on in places where you don't care about the surface quality (e.g. where the vinyl wraps into the fairings and under the array). Note that the solvent in the vinyl edge sealer appears to dissolve the vinyl's original adhesive before the edge sealer itself cures. Therefore the vinyl may peel up quickly where you apply vinyl edge sealer if the vinyl is under a lot of tension. Just make sure someone keeps an eye on your edges while the edge sealer dries.When it comes time to seal the edges of your vinyl between multiple pieces of vinyl, the best technique the team found in 2013 was to use a large syringe (or eyedropper if necessary) to force edge sealer between the vinyl seam. Then use a soft Silicone squeegee to wipe up the excess edge sealer. The team used a 1"^2 square of the greg solar module silicone laminator diaphragm as a squeegee. They cut a tapered edge to give the silicone a sharp edge. If you curve the squeegee into a U shape and drag the silicone along the seam the excess edge sealer will pool into a blob along the base of the U. This will allow excess edge sealer to flow into places that you applied insufficient edge sealer, and it will also ensure that the width of the edge sealer overlap is uniform and pretty. The team used 3 coatings of edge sealer in 2013 in places where they used the squeegee technique since the silicone removed the majority of the edge sealer.

* If you remove all of the release film on a sheet of vinyl the vinyl will become unwieldily. The exposed adhesive will stick to itself and eventually the sheet will crumple into a wadded mess. Leave the majority of the release film while you work and only remove 1ft at a time. You want enough vinyl so that you have a section that you can stretch to work around curves, but you don't want so much that the vinyl sticks to itself. 
* If the vinyl's adhesive does stick to itself you will want to warm the vinyl before you pull it apart. If you rip the vinyl apart you will occasionally tear holes in the vinyl in places where the adhesive was stronger than the vinyl itself. Warming the vinyl seems to help.
* If you lay down a section of vinyl and notice that there is dust below the vinyl you can lift the vinyl off and use tweezers to remove the dust. However, you run the risk of the vinyl lifting off flakes of Surface Master if you try to lift off the vinyl.
* Making nice butted seams is kind of tricky. In 2013 the team started by laying down one piece of vinyl. Then we used a straight edge to define straight edges. You can also use masking tape to define straight or curved lines that you intend to cut. We cut the vinyl along our guide leaving an exposed vinyl edge. Next we wrapped a second sheet with excess material extending over the original vinyl piece. Using the non-fuzzy side of a squeegee we pressed the second piece of vinyl firmly into the notch created by the exposed edge of the first piece of vinyl. Then we cut the second piece of vinyl as carefully as possible along the visible notch. You will have to experiment on a separate pair of vinyl sheets before starting to determine where on the notch you need to cut to get perfectly butted seams. If you cut too high the pieces will overlap. if you cut too low you will leave a gap.
* If you do accidentally leave unsightly gaps it helps to use a permanent marker to recolor the exposed Surface Master below before you seal the seam with edge sealer. 
* If you are cutting curved lines make sure you step back and ensure that your masking tape guide looks good before you take the razor blades out.

* Remember that every surface imperfection in your Bondo will print through your vinyl. The only exception is holes that are smaller than 0.25" or so. Bumps, dust, surfaces that are not curvature continuous will definitely show up. You also need to remember that pre-vinyl wrapped carbon masks a lot of the surface imperfections that will be clearly visible in the final vinyl. It is difficult to identify a small defect in a camouflaging sea of Bondo, Surface Master, carbon, and glue.Be especially diligent with your Bondo work and sanding before you even think about vinyl. If you can feel surface roughness you will have a problem. If you can see surface roughness before you start to vinyl wrap the aero team will take you behind a shed. Once you are certain that you have done a good Bondo job, the best way to prove yourself wrong is to pre-wrap sections of the car that are liable to be problematic. Large expanses of flat Surface Master with no foaming adhesive between the carbon and Surface Master will likely be okay. However, the regions near the zones that you needed to do Bondo work on will probably need to be checked. To check the surface first wipe down the surface with IPA. Then cut generously sized rectangles of vinyl and apply them to the car. If the vinyl surface looks fine, you are good to go. If there are imperfections then pull out the sanders and Bondo for another week of manual labor. Also, if you find it tricky to apply large-ish sized rectangles of vinyl now you will have a tough time applying huge sheets of vinyl.

* Move the car to a clean room (e.g. the Seminar Room) before you start wrapping the car.
* Spray off large dust particles with compressed air. If you only try to wipe them off with a solvent you will just spread them around instead of removing them.
* Clean the car with a solvent every time you bring it out of the mech room to continue vinyl wrapping. IPA doesn't appear to adversely affect the vinyl. Avoid getting acetone or MEK on the vinyl unless you know it won't cause short term or long term issues.
* Be careful around sections of the carbon that have foaming adhesive between the carbon and the Surface Master. Using foaming adhesive as a filler next to array wiring channels or other sharp corners allows you to avoid the need to diligently stuff carbon into these curves, but the Surface Master loves to flake off when it is attached to foaming adhesive instead of flat carbon. The holes left behind when the Surface Master flakes generally won't print through into the vinyl, but if you get Surface Master dust on the vinyl the dust will show up. Remember that positive defects on your surface show up a lot more than negative defects. You are most likely to flake off Surface Master if you allow a sheet of vinyl to tack down to the car and then you try to reposition the vinyl. Make sure you don't let the vinyl tack in to the wrong place if there is Surface Master on foaming adhesive. Pre-wrapping sections of Surface Master with foaming adhesive and then ripping off the vinyl may tear off most of the Surface Master that is likely to flake off, but it doesn't eliminate the issue
* Try to do your vinyl wrapping on a warm day. If temperatures are close to freezing you can actually rip/shatter the vinyl when you try to stretch it. The hotter the temperatures the more the vinyl will stretch even without heat guns.
* You will want a team of at least two to apply the vinyl. One person will be manning the squeegee. One person will be pulling the vinyl taught. If you have a third person they can manage the heat gun. One person wrapping alone takes 3 times as long as two people working together.
* The person who helps to stretch will need to put uniform tension on the vinyl to help prevent wrinkles. The best way to do this is to wrap the end of the vinyl around a rigid metal rod and pull on the rod. If you try to grab the vinyl without a rod to distribute the force you will distort the vinyl and start wrinkles.
* Make sure everyone that touches the vinyl or the car surface wears gloves. Skin oils significantly reduce the vinyl's tackiness
* Once you have squeegees out and you are applying the vinyl note that the felt covered side of vinyl squeegees doesn't leave as many scratches as the bare silicone side. However, the bare silicone side does a better job of dissipating wrinkles that are about to form. 
* If you are wrapping and you notice that wrinkles are starting to bunch up in the vinyl you need to have your partner pull the vinyl taught. Heat that section with the wrinkles and they will hopefully disappear. If they don't then use the silicone side of the squeegee to press out the wrinkles while the vinyl is still hot.
* Keep the vinyl warm/hot while you are applying it.You don't need to apply a ton of heat and tension when you are applying the vinyl to flat surfaces, but it helps when you are applying to curved surfaces.

### Notes on Vinyl Graphics Designs

[](#h.4jmgay3xf45o)

Things to keep in mind for your designs.

* If you want to use Stanford identity elements (colors, emblems, fonts, etc.) visit the official usage page for an overview of University policies. 
* We will be printing the design on vinyl wrap, so patterns or other uniformly spaced shapes will probably become distorted when we stretch the graphics on the car.
* Make sure you have a design that will allow us to place sponsors' logos on the car. Visit this link to download a bunch of sample sponsor logos.
