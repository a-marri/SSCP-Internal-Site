## SSCP - Suspension Design

## Suspension Design

The suspension, apart from the chassis design and fabrication, may be the single most difficult mechanical task in building a solar car. The number of variables and choices that the designer must take into account is enormous. Furthermore, the suspension is one of the driving variables behind the shape of the aerobody, in particular the fairings. Therefore, the suspension geometry must be developed in tandem with the aerobody so that interferences and hacks aren't present in the final model.

### Functions of a Solarcar Suspension?

* Limit loads on the tires/rims to prevent blowouts and rim failure.Limit loads on the chassis during bumpy conditions and cattle grates.Limit transmitted vibrations to the chassis for driver comfort, loading cycles, and electronics reliability.Keep the car dynamically stable at all times. This means that the car must always default to a straight line if the driver's hands are removed from the wheel.

### Design Variables:

### Design Procedure:

#### Solidworks Geometry Development

2D Bump Geometry

A solidworks sketch was made with the following procedure:

* defined the geometry of one wheel's suspension from the front view, including two a-arms, the steering axis, and the wheel.
* copied this geometry two times, for three total. added equal relations between all major members in each copy of the sketch, and then dimensions to define the geometry except for one degree of freedom. these three sketches represented the suspension at ride height, full bump, and full droop.&#x20;
* Define the position of the contact patch center at each of these three positions. In order to minimize bump scrub, I defined the ride height condition to have zero camber, and the three contact patches to be coincident to a circle of a relatively large radius. defining them as directly vertical is geometrically impossible.
* when the correct combinations of relations and dimensions were achieved, the geometry sketch solved for the lengths of the a-arms and their positions in the y-z plane.

After all of these constraints were solved for, the geometry that resulted resembled a relatively standard SLA double wishbone suspension, with all of our desired characteristics.

3D Static Geometry

Taking the 2D geometry to 3D was relatively straightforward, but required a lot of dimensions to simply be chosen. Some of the basic dimensions as they stand now:

&#x20;Caster Angle

&#x20;A-arm width

&#x20;5 deg

&#x20;600mm

In the process of building the suspension as a 3D sketch, some additional design decisions were made. It was decided that the suspension should be a simple multi-link geometry, with the bottom control arm split into two independent links. This served a dual function: first, it allowed us to put the steering axis through the virtual center of this new 4-bar linkage, which put the steering axis inside the wheel itself and decreased the volume that the wheel swept through in steer travel and therefore the size of the fairing; second, the dual hardpoints on the upright rather than one large rod-end on the end of a traditional control arm gave us a lot more flexibility in the mechanical design of the upright and wheel-motor.&#x20;

After the decision to move to multi-link was made, the 2D bump geometry was reworked accordingly.

### Kinematics

Lotus Shark

We used a piece of software by Lotus called Shark to do simple kinematic analysis of the geometry, and to calculate forces at the hardpoints given certain loading conditions at the wheel. The output from the final suspension geometry is shown below:

### Testing Procedure:

\[TBD]

### Measuring Toe

1. Measure the toe of the car from different points on the wheel as well as rotating the tire. This must be done at nominal ride height to get an accurate measurement. We have a very nice, expensive tool for measuring changes in toe. I suggest that you use it.
2. Remove the shock and measure the toe change as the ride height changes. This is easy to do with the car lift.&#x20;
3. Plot this data against the data generated by SHARK. If the two are the same, then, and ONLY THEN, can you assume that the toe you measure in the shop will be the same while driving.
4. Now go driving, enjoying the comfort of knowing that your suspension is not eating $500 michelins.

#### Ride Height

Final optimal ride height. These values are measured from trailing edge and lowest point on lights. Make sure car has correct ballast.
