## SSCP - Steering System

## Steering System

The steering system consisits of the rack and pinion, the steering shaft, and the steering wheel

### Steering Wheel

To make it easy to remove the wheel during ingress and egress we have traditionally mounted our wheels on a quick release. Because we frequently like to put buttons in our steering wheel its nice if the quick disconnect has a integrated connector. Two possible sources are

* SPA Racing (Used on Xenith was very heavy and had noticeable backlash)

### Steering Shaft

The shaft primarily needs to transmit torque so a hollow shaft is preferable. For Xenith we used a carbon tube from Rockwest Composites who makes very nice carbon mandral wound carbon fiber tubes. For apogee a titanium tube was selected.&#x20;

#### Collapsing System

New for 2013 WSC rules were added that mandate the steering shaft collapses in the event of an accident. Possible solutions are listed below:

### Steering Rack

Steering racks are very tricky to find for solarcar. Most are either way to large and heavy or cheap and have lots of backlash which makes the car difficult to drive at speed. For apogee a lower quality rack was used which developed bad backlash which made the car difficult to drive. For Xenith we used a very high quality rack from Woodward Precision Power Steering it has adjustments to eliminate backlash; however, its center steel shaft makes it very heavy. We should consider gun drilling the shaft as ourselves next time.&#x20;

Kaz Technologies has a steering rack that may be worth considering for future cars http://www.kaztechnologies.com/fsae/steering-rack/

### Steering Bearing

For Xenith and Luminos we used a plastic flange mount spherical bearing from IGUS. &#x20;
