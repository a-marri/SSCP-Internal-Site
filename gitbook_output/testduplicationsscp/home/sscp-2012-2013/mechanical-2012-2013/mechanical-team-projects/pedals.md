## Pedal Sensors

[](#h.59gjc495k34c)

To transfer the signal of the pedal rotating in a non-jank way an analog sensor is suggested as it can be made more noise immune than a pure digital sensor. Honeywell make a nice line of hall sensors that would be suitable in their RTY series which have a nice AMP SuperSeal connector header integrated.Â
