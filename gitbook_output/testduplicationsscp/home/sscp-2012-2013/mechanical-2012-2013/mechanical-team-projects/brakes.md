Teams after 2013 should avoid using legacy Hayes Stroker Ace brake sets. These brakes worked well on Xenith and Luminos, but they have been discontinued for a number of years and are increasingly difficult to source.

2013 Brake System:

We used four Hayes Stroke Ace Mountain Bike Brakes with Shimano RT-78 rotors. We used 203mm rotors on the front with 180mm rotors on the rear. The master cylinders were Ducati Monster cylinders

We used a post-machined: Shimano, Disc Brake 180mm Rotor Set, Centerlock, SM-RT78M for the rear brake rotor

This is the front: Shimano XT Disc Brake Rotor SM- RT78 203mm w/ lockring

Brake fluid readily absorbs moisture from the air, so you always want to use unopened bottles of brake fluid when you fill or flush a brake system. If you use an old bottle of brake fluid from last cycle it is liable to have water in it even if the cap appears to be screwed on.

If there are any opened bottles of brake fluid in the shop you should dispose them with EH\&S, and buy new bottles of DOT 4 fluid or whatever brake fluid type your brake master cylinder and calipers require.

If there are left over bottles that still have their tamper-proof seal on you are probably fine to use them.
