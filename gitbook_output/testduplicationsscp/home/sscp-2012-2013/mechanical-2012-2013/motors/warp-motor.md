## Summary

[](#h.5oed8bat5g25)

This motor is a collaboration between Sam Lenius from the University of Minnesota Solar Vehicle Project and Nathan Hall-Snyder of SSCP. The intention is to create a scaled down motor with high efficiency and extremely high reliability for use in the team's 2013 vehicle. The decreased size requires the use of two motors to meet the torque requirements for the World Solar Challenge.

### Motor Log

[](#h.60g9xxok4h2o)

(Insert new log items here!)

October 2017

Warp 1 and 2 (silver motors) were swapped into Sundae in Darwin to evenly wear bearings.  These motors, Warp 1 and 2, were used for all static and dynamic scrutineering and raced WSC 2017 with no issues.

September 2017

Warp 3 and 4 (black motors) were used to test in Australia with no issues.

August 2017

Warp 3 and 4 (black motors) were disassembled by Rachel and Sarah S to swap bearings and motor caps (to mate with Sundae's upright) and reassembled.  Brake rotors of Warp 1, 2, 3, and 4 replaced.  Warp 1 and 2 (silver motors) were used for some dynamic testing at Crow's landing, neighborhood drives, and Sundae's first Central Valley test drive.  Warp 3 and 4 (black motors) were used for the second Central Valley test drive.  No issues.

July 2017

Warp 1 and 2 (silver motors) were disassembled by Rachel to swap bearings and motor caps (to mate with Sundae's upright) and reassembled.

November 2016

Disassembled warp 2 completely and performed Zyglow dye penetrant test on it. No cracks were revealed.

October 2016

Used a fluorescent dye penetration kit (Zyglow) to test the motor spindle for cracks. No cracks were revealed, so we reassembled Warp 1 with that spindle and new bearings.

April 2016

Used a red dye penetration kit (Spotcheck) to test the motors for cracks. The quality of the test came into question because though we were not able to find any cracks, we were also not able to do so on an aluminum sheet that we hit many times with a hammer. See here for detailed results and photos.

October 2015

Motors 1 and 2 (Silver Motors) were raced across Australia with no problems during the race. An intermittent open circuit in a poorly-made resolver cable caused torque reversal before the race...see the issues section for more info.

September 2015

Sam L and Nathan swapped out the low-torque rotors on motors 1 and 2 for new high torque rotors 8 and 11. The rubber stator compression ring was also replaced with the cork version used on motors 3 and 4. Excess glue was removed from the area where the rubber compression ring used to be. No obvious wear was observed on the inside of the motors. Torque putty was applied to all reinstalled bolts and the bearing nut.

May 2015

The bearings on motor 3 were replaced by Nathan, Darren, Aravind, and Harry. No damage was observed to the removed bearings. One of the set screws in the bearing locknut was semi-stripped. It was therefore not torqued to the required spec, but still firmly engaged. Nathan recommends that this set screw be replaced upon next service. No torque putty was applied to the bearing locknut, rear case bolts, or front bolts since the torque putty at the shop was dried out.

August 2014

At the request of team lead Guillermo, Nathan and Michael took a look at the risk of fatigue on the titanium spindles. The results of that analysis are a subpage of this page here.

[here](/stanford.edu/testduplicationsscp/home/sscp-2012-2013/mechanical-2012-2013/motors/motor-spindle-longevity-analysis)

January 2014

Nathan disassembled the left motor, replaced the bearings, and inspect all components. No unexpected wear was found. Notes of wear - blackened grease around the inner bearing indicates that the inner bearing outer race is rotating in place.

October 2013

Motors 3 and 4 (Black Motors) were raced across Australia with no problems (!).

Early October 2013

Luminos was dropped off sawhorses to the (left) during testing in Oz. The brake rotor on motor 4 was replaced. No lasting damage was believed to be sustained after the replacement.

One of the motors appeared to cut out while driving. Root cause was the backshell of the resolver connector not being fully screwed in.

Summer 2013

Motors 1 and 2 were driven a total of one WSC's worth of test miles, mostly in the Central Valley. Several problems were identified, including failed Molex Microfit connectors and heat damage to magnets.

### Motor Status

[](#h.vmq7mee0yq46)

For Luminos, a total of four stators, four cases, and six rotors were manufactured. Rotors 1 and 2 were damaged by excess heat during the magnet glue heating process and as such have lower torque than the other motors. They should be considered mechanical samples or backups only.

Rotors 3 and 4 have smaller magnets, lower torque, but a higher top speed.

Rotors 5 and 6 have a different magnet design, higher torque, but a lower top speed.

The efficiency is is essentially the same between the two rotor configurations (within .5%)

## Efficiency Data

[](#h.tqgjleksnq6g)

The plots are of low speed torque vs current with both the original design and the new design rotors, a plot of estimated system cruise efficiency by convolving max's power to drive curve through a bilinear interpolation of efficiency points collected on the dyno, and an example of the type of data that I have collected (in this case Motor 2 with a high torque rotor).

Remember that this data is of electrical power into the controller to mechanical power output of the motor. It combines the losses of the controller and the motor into a single number.

The new rotors will give ~20% higher torque then the original design. This will come at the expense of a limit to top speed at low battery voltages. With the black edition rotors, top speed will be around 70MPH at top of pack, 62MPH at nominal voltage and 53MPH at effective bottom of pack.

## Known Issues

[](#h.awjz39jnbqlb)

### In-Service Failures

[](#h.tkgr992dj2i6)

Resolver Cable Failure #2

The field-wireable cable was improperly assembled, resulting in an intermittent open-circuit that confused the resolver board and resulted in inconsistent and dangerous torque changes. Several resistor values were also discovered to be improperly specified on the Tritium resolver board.

Resolver Cable Failure

The Molex Microfit connectors on the Tritium Resolver adapter board had an intermittent open, causing unpredictable behavior of the motor.

Resolver Connector 

The 8 Pin M12 connector on the motor was not fully screwed down, causing unpredictable behavior of the motor.

Bearing Failure

While not specifically on the motor, the rear hub of Luminos suffered a bearing failure that caused more noticeable bearing drag (during a free spin test). The cause of the failure is unknown, though suspected to be dust ingress.

Bearing Thermal Tolerances (SOLVED)

When the motor heats up to operating temperatures, the tolerance within the bearings changes, causing more play in on the motor shaft. While not known to cause problems, it nonetheless deviates from the motor design intent. This has since been root caused to a tolerance issue on a fillet on the rims. A too-large radius prevented the rims from fully seating. The rims were sanded down and the problem was fixed.

Using Permabond 940, add lines of glue to the outside of the stack. This will wick in between the laminations and tack them together. After adding 15 or so lines of glue, wait 10-15min and then remove the stacking compression.

1. Double check the stack height, it may have relaxed slightly after the mass is removed. Remove or add laminations as required.
2. Add glue to the entire surface of the stator, inside and outside. Use a paper towel to spread out drops. 
3. Ensure that extra glue is added to the laminations on the ends, they are the most likely to be accidentally removed.

1. Verify that all windings meet the clearance requirements (15mm MAX resolver side, 13mm MAX brake rotor side)
2. Remove all items from the stator that don't need epoxy(varflex tubing, etc)
3. Mask the outside with blue tape
4. Preheat the oven to 90C
5. Prepare .5L of 3M [INSERT 3M PRODUCT NUMBER HERE] two-part epoxy.
6. Drape a large piece of stretchable vacuum bag into a harbor freight pressure bucket. Zip tie in place around the bucket
7. Place .5L of casting resin in the vacuum bag
8. Place the stator, with windings completed and tested, into the bucket.
9. Connect the vacuum pump THROUGH THE RESIN TRAP. FAILURE TO DO SO WILL RESULT IN DESTRUCTION OF PUMP!!!
10. Pull full vacuum on the bucket for 15 minutes.
11. Remove stator, wipe as clean as possible, paying particular attention to the edges that will seat on the motor
12. Hang in the oven with string
13. Bake for 8 hours. Check in at 1 hour to wipe off excess glue droplets
14. Re-verify that the windings meet the clearance requirements (15mm MAX resolver side, 13mm MAX brake rotor side)
15. Verify that motor leads are free to twist
16. Cut motor leads to [INSERT MOTOR LEAD LENGTH HERE]
17. Install var-flex tubing over motor leads
18. Install MX150 crimps, Male
19. Heat-shrink over MX150 crimps, holding var-flex tubing in place
20. Glue Varflex tubing to the stator with 3M CA-50 flexible Cyanoacrylate
21. You're done!

### Rotor Purchasing

[](#h.hnh3cmme64wg)

The high and low torque rotors differ in both laminations and magnets. Drawings (and correspondence from ordering) are attached to this page. The high torque rotors require "rotor2" and "magnet - N42SH - high torque" in "Luminos_Ordering_History.zip". Note that the low torque (both N42SH and SM26U) files and quotes may be found in this zip file, but Sam says that low torque rotors should not be re-made without a magnet redesign.

Rotor lamination stacks are 60mm tall, and high torque magnets are 15mm long. Thus, each rotor requires (60/15)*14 = 56 North, and the same number of South magnets. 

## Simulation Results

2014 Work:

Currently working on building a full FEA motor dyno. Starting by simulating the Black Edition motor configuration as-built with the aim of having the simulation reflect as closely as possible the measured results on the motor dyno.

8/27/2014 Simulation Progress

By reducing corner radii and adjusting the tooth tip design I was able to increase the copper area available by ~50%. Looking at previous results it looked like the majority of losses were copper losses. By working the iron higher, I was able to bring the losses more into balance. There are some outstanding questions about whether or not the windings will actually fit in the case and if there will be anomalous eddy losses due to lines of flux crossing the slot, but this looks like progress.

Next I'm going to look into more optimization of the tooth geometry.

Silver Motor Upgrade

During the summer of 2015, we made new high torque rotors for the two lower uncoated motors. We made new magnets and rotor steel, we cut new aluminum rotors and we assembled them into the two motors.

Rotor 11 was assembled into motor housing 1 and rotor 8 was assembled into motor housing 2.
