## SSCP - Software

## Software

Hiya,

Thanks for starting on this! Let me know if you have any questions about any of this; would be more than happy to chat or help out as necessary.

tools we use for aero:

CAD (surface/draw cars)

meshing (turn CAD into geometry to compute)

CFD (computational fluid dynamics)

visualization (what it sounds like, the colorful plots)

* core computation (processing hours on a core cluster somewhere)

current tools / existing relationships:

Pointwise (meshing) - had 4 floating licenses for 2015 cycle; renew sponsorship and potentially acquire more licenses (like 6?). license use would be starting ASAP and good through the end of 2016 or even into 2017.&#x20;

Tecplot (visualization) - have an academic license relationship with School of Engineering, inquire within school about getting licenses on SSCP computers

Sabalcore (core computation) - they donated (iirc) 100k core hours that we used to run CFD for the 2015 cycle. we used this up and had to buy more, which I think we got at a discount. since we're starting aero earlier we'll need even more hours; however we may want to look into other companies for additional donations. renew this sponsorship, but we may want to save this for the aero design in the summer/fall and find computation clusters elsewhere for training/experimentation during the winter/spring. last time was up to 300 cores at once, 500GB storage on their servers (I believe).&#x20;

new pursuits:

NX (CAD) - made by Siemens, a direct competitor to SolidWorks; they offer the same academic licensing deal that SolidWorks has. given that Stanford has SolidWorks academic license already, unsure that we can get NX the same way. have heard from Michigan that Siemens is reasonably generous/responsive, so we could just approach them as SSCP and explain that we want to use their tools to design our car (more of a real software sponsorship approach). also not sure if  see if they'll give us licenses for the "whole team" -- quote 12\~30 people, whatever seems reasonable. student licenses or full? I filled out their web "contact us" form over winter break but haven't heard back. Try phone if email doesn't yield results.

STAR-CCM+ (meshing, CFD, visualization) - industry software used for aero, rolls all the features into one suite that makes it more robust and easier to automate. website openly advertises free academic/student license -- not sure if we would want to go through Stanford on this; aero dept. might already have existing software relationships with competing software or devoted to our school's open source stuff? I haven't used it before but would like to have as an option to try.&#x20;

I put in a student/academic request via their webform on 10 January, if I don't hear back in 2 weeks I'll pass it off to you guys to make it a sponsorship request.

additional core computation - looking into other companies, as mentioned in sabalcore section we'll likely need more than they donate (unless they're willing to significantly up their amount).&#x20;

already have:

SolidWorks (CAD) - already have via Stanford, university academic license

SU2 (CFD) - open-source Stanford developed code, should have access

Again, thanks so much and let me know if there's anything else you need from me!

Cheers,

Anna
