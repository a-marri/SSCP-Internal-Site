## Installation Procedure for New Members (NOT VALID AFTER DEC 31 2014)

[](#h.w99i1mxwd1u9)

Read the Setup PDF inside the folder before you start SW installation. It guides you through proper server address and what to include. You will need to be connected to Stanford internet or VPN'd in from outside the network to be able to run the software. Remember to extract the whole zipped download folder to be able to install it to WINDOWS only. 

Here is the link http://lib.stanford.edu/terman-engineering-library/software 32 bit and 64 bit.

If you're new to SW, you can get started by going through all the tutorials (in Help menu).

If you try to install Solidworks but your installer opens with a blank screen visit this page for instructions on using a different installer.

## Mac Users

[](#h.z191riioyxb2)

You're going to need to bootcamp your machine in order to run windows in a separate hard drive partition before you can install SolidWorks. 

First, get access to the FTP server, and download the contents of the /Software/Windows 7 Licensed directory. There should be one .ISO disc image file, and one .txt file with an activation key. Write down the key on a piece of paper.

[ FTP server](/stanford.edu/testduplicationsscp/home/new-member-orientation/sftp-access)

Next, run a spotlight search (Command + Spacebar) for "Boot Camp Assistant", and open the Boot Camp Assistant tool. Boot Camp Assistant will turn a flash drive (must be 4GB or larger, and any data on the drive will be erased) or blank DVD into a bootable installer device. If you don't have a blank DVD, your dorm chatlist is your friend. 

Make sure all three option boxes are selected, and click next. Select the .ISO disc image file downloaded from the FTP server as the image file that Boot Camp Assistant will burn to your media device. (You can format the USB drive after installation to be able to use it as a flash drive again).  

Finally, armed with your new windows install disc and key, follow the on-screen prompts (or these instructions) to install bootcamp and get windows on your machine.
