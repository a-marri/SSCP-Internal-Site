May 2015 Notes:

Keller Industries has been great in that they do so much work for free (as long as we bring homemade baked goods) but there slow turnaround time has been an issue.  Therefore, it'd be good to have other waterjet cutting options lined up as alternates.

 

    1) We have a Stanford connection with BT Laser that might be good for future water jet cutting needs (they were too busy at the time):

        rick@btlaser.net

        josh@btlaser.net

        edgar@btlaser.net

    2) Shane's Water Cutting in Hayward (will not cut fiberglass - too messy)

    3) H20 Precision Inc. in Hayward (will not cut fiberglass/nomex honeycomb) - would be a good                 option for other materials - (510) 781-0746

    

    4) Platinum Water Jet Cutting (510) 441-6172 - have offered services to Stanford students before
