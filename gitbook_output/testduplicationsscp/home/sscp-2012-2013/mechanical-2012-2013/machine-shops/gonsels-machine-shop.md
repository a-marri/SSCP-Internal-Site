# Gonsels Machine Shop

Gonsels Machine Shop is a family business on the East Bay near Oakland. They are one of our team's most important sponsors, but we have had somewhat tenuous relations with Gonsels in the past. 

Jim Gonsalves currently runs Gonsels and his our main contact. In the 2000s (possibly earlier) our team had a very strong relationship with Gonsels. The Gonsalves family mentored the ME people on the team to teach them how to design parts that would be easy to machine. The team consequentially sent orders to Gonsels that were relatively easy to machine and Jim was happy to manufacture the parts for our team for free. During the Xenith and Luminos years the team became more ambitious in their mechanical designs and the team stopped their tradition of sending engineers to chill at Gonsels's shop to learn about designing for ease of manufacturing. The parts that the team sent to Gonsels in the 2010s were significantly more complicated and time consuming for Gonsels to manufacture. The team also didn't give Gonsels adequate time to manufacture the parts given the fact that their shop had to prioritize paying customers over their pro-bono work for our team. The team team demanded too much of Jim and his company damaging the relationship between Jim and our team. Mid way through Luminos's manufacturing cycle Jim said he was unwilling to continue manufacturing additional parts for our team, and we had to manufacture a handful of the remaining parts for Luminos ourselves. 

After the team realized their mistake the team talked to Jim and concluded that it would be best to return to the type of relationship that the team had when they first started working with Jim and his shop.

If the team uses Gonsels as a machine shop in future years it is critical that the team give Gonsels plenty of time to manufacture the parts. Also, be sure to design parts that require only simple machining operations. If you can get Jim's input during the early design phase, so we don't create an excessive burden for his shop.
