Go to McMaster and add the parts you want to your shopping cart. Once you have built an order on your McMaster account click "Forward" in your shopping cart to forward the purchase requisition to the Team Lead. You will be able to send an e-mail to the address you designate that includes a link to view and place the order. Once you send the email, the order will no longer appear on your account. Please also send the Team Lead a short email to explain why you need the components that you are requesting.
