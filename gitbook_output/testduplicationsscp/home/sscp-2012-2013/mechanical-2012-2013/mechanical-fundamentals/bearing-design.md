### HOW TO DESIGN STUFF WITH BEARINGS

Before starting, I suggest you read the SKF Guide to Bearing Design for Electric Motors: http://www.promshop.info/cataloguespdf/rolling.pdf

Sweet! Now, you can start designing bearings!

* Determine the static and dynamic loads for the bearing set in kN or kgF, using math and the loading conditions at the bottom of the Mechanical page. Then select the appropriate factor of safety based on the expected loads. NOTE: THIS IS COUNTER-INTUITIVE AND INVOLVES MATH, SEE BELOW:Static load is the greatest load that the bearing will ever see during a transient event, e.g. shockDynamic load is the steady state rotating load. Use the SKF factor of safety table to determine the derating factor of your bearing. For the Warp Motor we used the noise-unimportant >=1,5 for the outer, shock-loaded bearing and >= 1 for the inner, non-shock-loaded bearing.

* Bearing assemblies must not be "hyper-static", or over-defined. Bearing Assemblies must not be hyper-static on both the outer and inner races. Common ways of making sure this is correct include using a deep groove bearing (defines both axial and radial motion) and a roller bearing (defines only radial motion).

1. Bearing assemblies should have the proper pre-load. Preload is the amount of axial force applied to a bearing to keep the bearing system constrained. Some bearing types do well with preload, others do not. Preload is specified by the manufacturer, though you will need to choose between none, light, medium, and heavy preload. For example, Deep groove bearings should not be excessively preloaded, but tapered roller bearings and angular contact bearings generally have a large amount of preload. How is preload accomplished?

Determine the bearing tolerances: This is a call-out in an engineering drawing pointing to a bearing face, determined by surface specification of the bearings and the material of your part. See the Misumi Guide for what each fit class does: http://www.misumiusa.com/CategoryImages/Metric\_2006\_pdf/METRIC1835-1836.pdf.&#x20;

NOTE: OFTEN BEARINGS ARE SLIGHTLY UNDERSIZED FROM THEIR SPECIFIED DIAMETER. CONFIRM THAT THE BEARING IS THE SIZE YOU THINK IT IS BEFORE DESIGNING TOLERANCES. CONSIDER GIVING THE BEARING TO THE MACHINE SHOP FOR BETTER RESULTS.&#x20;

* Do your best to match the Coefficients of Thermal Expansion of your materials. If your bearings are 440C Stainless, use a 440C Stainless shaft. If the bearing is press-fit into aluminum, use a J7 fit instead of a H7 fit to make sure that the bearing is still held tightly even after expansion.

1. Prefer standard bearing sizes, so that if one manufacturer is being slow, we can use another.
2. If designing a motor, you should design for possible high voltages!Any conductive loop in your motor can pick up stray flux and induce voltages, especially with a fast-switching motor controller! This includes loops between the stator, bearings, and rotor.Any motor can act as a parallel-plate capacitor and accumulate charge, which might eventually discharge through the grease in your bearings!These factors may affect your design to varying degrees, depending on the motor design. On a two-bearing motor, using one conductive (metal) and one non-conductive (ceramic) bearing or using two SGR (shaft grounding rings,  http://www.est-aegis.com/ ) will solve the first, and most significant problem. Using two non-conductive bearings, or one SGR,  will solve the second problem. For reference, Tesla Motors uses two ceramic bearings for their motor.
