### Bolted Electrical Connections

#### High Current Bolted Connections to PCBS

* NEVER bolt directly to a PCB. PCB materials are plastic and will creep, especially at elevated temperaturesIf bolting to a PCB is required, always use lots of plated vias to support the joint.Always use a solderable bolt terminal such as those made by Keystone or WurthUse a high current connector (use the Connector Guide and/or Connector Selection Matrices to find a suitable connector)

#### Bolted Connection Stackup

* Read Electrical Connection Guidelines.pdf for extensive details on the topic of bolted electrical connectionsUse a ring terminal (not spade) crimped with a ball detent or hexagonal crimper with the correct gauge wire and dieDo not use a pre-insulated terminal without pull-testing a sampleHeat-shrink the terminal with self-adhesive heatshrinkUse stainless hardware to prevent galvanic effectsUse electrical joint grease on the electrical interface. Do not place a washer or any other part in between electrical surfacesUse a flat washer and belleville washer to keep preload on the joint despite thermal changesTORQUE THE FASTENER TO THE CORRECT FOR THE SIZE AND GRADE OF BOLT!!!Use a locking compound or ridged belleville washer to prevent loosening.

#### High Voltage Cable

* Choose wire with high strand count (welding cable is a good option for motor/battery pack connections)Use danger orange to indicate HV where sensible (motor phase wires)Never violate the Red = Positive Black = Negative convention.  High Voltage Wire used for Luminos:Motor phase lines: Orange Eco-Wire, 10gaHigh Voltage Bus: H+S 12 582 674, recommended by TE for use with HVA 280 Connectors.&#x20;

#### High Voltage Clearance and Creepage Requirements for HV

* Minimum open air clearance constraint between HV connection is 5mm4mm between any HV bus bar and any other piece of metal (this prevents voltage from shorting through an intermediary piece of metal like a standoff)
* Minimum open air clearance constraint between HV connection is 5mm
* 4mm between any HV bus bar and any other piece of metal (this prevents voltage from shorting through an intermediary piece of metal like a standoff)
