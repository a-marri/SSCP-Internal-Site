Make sure no grease on wheels

Make sure all blind nuts are lock tight&#x20;

Make backup suspension pieces. Bolt on aluminum.&#x20;

Check the bearing seals

Check glue bond lines especially around suspension

Leaking oil on shocks

Are shocks robust and reliable?

Bad molex on tritium

Bad housings in tritium

Steering column strength on pillow bearing&#x20;

FSAE requires 30% of cells temp sense&#x20;

Ensure that battery bars are all well tightened&#x20;

Velvils  need a washer below them. Should not be fully tightened to the point that Velcro is flat. Should be able to Olsen a half turn with noticeable force

A locking nut joining modules would be good

Don't use nylon lock but if pack is too hot

Doesn't like split washers

Sometimes nylock nut on top of regular nut.&#x20;

Test resistance on joints with four line resistance

Set torque specs and torque putty in battery pack

All tesla HV joints are micro ohm tested

If you know what temp rise should be you can measure temp rise with current&#x20;

Torque bolts to failure if you don't know what torque to use

Make sure that voltage sense wires don't have too high of resistance otherwise you will get false positive of misbalanced cells

If you're bleeding then you will misbalanced your pack

Test for issue by turning bleeding on and off to as if voltage is an issue

Is clearance and creepage from HV to aluminum core sufficiently thick. If there is condensation you can create current paths

Product by binder. Will measure isolation between high voltage low voltage and chassis. IMD. Isolation measurement device

Check isolation before closing contractors

Everything conductive carbon needs to have max if 5 ohm resistance to ground so if there is ever a short you will never create a path. Chassis should.&#x20;

Bad that chassis is capacitively connected to motors

Ground everything

Use y caps to hold chassis voltage in the middle of high and low

Since chassis is 120v we may be okay. Over 40v is somewhat dangerous. You can get burns with arcing

A DC shock you feel when you grab and when. You let go. As long as not during 5% critical cycle of heart best okay.  AC you will always shock heart during bad phase of cycle

DC had no let go current. AC has a let concurrent problem.

Stuff nomex paper in the sides of box. Have an inner lid

Always have additional isolators over the modules

Kapton tape the core potting

You should be able to drop a screwdriver in the pack. Have individual isolators that cover regions of the pack

Have a gutter under the door seam to channel water away from the pack

Vinyl or paint the top of the pack&#x20;

Water ingress in the pack is bad

No way for the water to get out of the pack

Have a water drain in the pack

You don't want to producer hydrogen and oxygen through electrolysis&#x20;

Make sure there is clearance around fasteners for nuts. Never use wrong but size

If someone goes in with a nut driver they will knock off components

Can we use plastic nuts in packs

Don't allow fasteners to rattle off. Use nylon locknuts on fasteners in pack

Pack isn't idiot proof

Color code fasteners or something

Concern on nuts in can connector

Water will pool In uprights

Consider putting desiccant in the battery pack

Watch for condensation on modules

Have backup straps to hold car in

Water protect mppt box&#x20;
