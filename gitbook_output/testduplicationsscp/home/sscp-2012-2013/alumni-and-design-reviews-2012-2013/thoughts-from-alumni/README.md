## Thoughts from Alumni

Meeting with Mark and Alex in June 2012:

-Get a professional Australian weather forecaster to be embedded with the team. It would be the trip of their life and they could broadcast the race live from your caravan.&#x20;

-Rainy days are your friend. If you are smart you can beat the rich teams when there is chaos

-Iterate early and often. Put a lot of pressure on people who don't want to help

-If people say they want to do fun projects then say they are being wasteful and selfish

-Remember that losing the race is not fun. No volume of parting in Adelaide, backpacking in New Zealand, or lounging in the Bay of Thailand can wipe away the sour memories of a shitty race

-Be willing to fire people from the team or just forget about them if they don't show up any more

-How is building a successful car not cool enough? Why is building a shiny car that breaks down cooler?

-What is more rewarding: to build a successful project/company or a project/company with a lot of hype but that fails when it matters

-Anything on Xenith that can work in the current car should be stolen or duplicated without a brand new design. The more stuff we take from Xenith or Apogee the more likely we can do Lolz projects next summer. Plus the car will be well tested.

-If the race was in two months what would we steal from Xenith?

-Make deadlines even harder and make sure people realize that they are letting their teammates down

-Always being nice and respectful may not be the best for the team

-Politely let people know if they are not a good fit. Most Stanford students aren't actually fit for solar car if problem sets and midterms are their top priority, and you aren't doing them any favors by letting them hang on.

-Only invest in people who will return value to the team. If they can't produce then we will take them off the list

-Realize and publicize when we have problems that do not have a viable solution

-Make a very detailed list of things that we need and things that we want

-Realize that we are a resource poor team. We are not Michigan

-Remind people about our hierarchy of needs. Does weight matter? no. Does aero and power consumption matter? yes.

Create a list of wants and needs: We will only do cool projects and BS projects during the summer before the race. Finish your important project first and then you will have time for lolz projects

"Mark and I are of the firm belief that the team has simply shown itself (ahem, for the last 15 years), to truly not be interested in racing.  If they were, they would do things that racers do … including test miles.  We started WSC with 4000 miles… no team since has had 10% of that.  The team likes inventing cool new things.  No shame in that.  Why not focus on some innovative 'first' instead of pretending to want to race … but showing thru actions that the team's heart is really elsewhere?

&#x20;

Many different ideas for a 'first' that would be similar to a SSCP effort.  My idea is to have an autonomous vehicle go around the world by itself.  Before you start designing the new car, worth discussing whether or not racing is really where the team's heart is."

"1)      What do you want to accomplish? Cool technology, win races, create your own challenge and meet it? Yes, the first two are generally mutually exclusive J.

2\)      What has been done and learned? Much has been lost certainly, but even if you just captured 25% of it you’d be very far on your way indeed. Imagine a repository of information on such “solid” things as solar cells, array building, suspension design, body work, strategy, etc. Imagine a repository of softer things such as getting the team to work together, logistics, etc.

3\)      How does the network help you? Generally, the more design reviews the better. Can you get more people involved by using such things as skype, gotomeeting, webex or whatever other cool thing I’m sure I don’t know about. If you ask me to come to Stanford to two hours, I’ll do it, but if you ask me to meet with a few people online for ½ hour while I’m already eating lunch anyhow I’ll do it more often J.

4\)      How will you GUARANTEE that the next car is not raced until it has at least 2000 miles on it? Please stop making this mistake. Did you know that the Sunburner, from 1993, still holds the Stanford record for crossing Australia? It had a 6mx2m array (absolute peak peak power of 1300w at that size), two people in it, not-great aerodynamics but it just fucking ran and ran. The cells you have now are insane, the batteries better, aerocode as a plug-in to solidworks for crissakes,  and the real time information outstanding (yes we had no internet) AND WE STILL HOLD THE STANFORD RECORD. Please put us out of our misery.

&#x20;

If you’d like, come up to Burlingame in the next few weeks with the current and future leaders of the team and we’ll sketch some of this out. This is absolutely the ideal time to be laying this framework Wesley."

Here are a few thoughts. I had the fortune to be part of both a semi-disastrous team (B2B) and a winning one (Solstice). The main difference between the two solar cars was the team management. Money, resources, etc was fairly similar. Here are a few thoughts.

1. Make a singular goal for the team, and ensure that ALL resources are directed towards achieving it. If the team wants to win, then the main effort should be on finishing the car early enough to put thousands of test miles on it. Cut all other projects if it will prevent testing. Be very stern about this. A robust/road worthy car is way better than a slightly more efficient one. Being very focused helped Solstice win. Being unfocused ensured B2B's failure.

Note: winning isn't necessarily the only worthy goal the team could have. It could, instead, look to develop the most efficient/advanced/fast car, or to have every team member learn a new area (such as electrical/composites/etc). Thus, for example, making PPTs from scratch and 1-2% more efficient than previous models would make sense, even though it may take long and reduce the chance for adequate testing (and therefore, winning).

2. One thing that helps tremendously, of course, is a core group of highly motivated people who have raced previously. This provides adequate wisdom, leadership, and technical expertise.
3. Ensure the safety of your drivers. Don't include design elements that could overtly increase their chances of harm/flipping/spinning out.
4. What went very poorly for B2B was our choice of an experimental battery pack. It ended up catching fire. For Solstice we went with commercial Li-ion cells. Stick with tested components.
5. The last huge thing that went poorly for B2B was bad team personal dynamics. There was stuff such as talking behind people's back and marginalizing people which was not only rude but destructive to team cohesion. Team leadership ensured that none of that happened during Solstice, which was not only more pleasant but also more successful.
6. Lastly, I will stress....put thousands of miles on the car before the race if you want to win.Finish the car with ample time. Cut other projects that don't enable this. And don't think you are smart enough to do everything. Hard choices have to be made.

My #1 piece of advice, which I'm sure everyone else will echo, and which you've probably heard already, is that reliability trumps all else. Before you work on fancy new features or your fairing doors, be sure the car will be able to drive for 5000 miles without breaking. Beyond that, things get more specific, but the number of teams who can make a whole race without a breakdown are few, and moving under your own power the entire time at a slower speed is worth way more than going 65 mph for the whole time except the times when you're going 0mph to fix problems. going 0mph makes your average speed plummet VERY fast :)

&#x20;

I'd be happy to talk about specific problems if there are specific questions at some point, but I think you could spend a whole build cycle making the car reliable, so si'll leave it at that for now! :)

Good luck!!!!

What went well for my team?

* In the 01-03 cycle, the main thing that went well was we realized

that we need to build a new car every cycle to make it interesting for

everyone, retain members, and feel like we had some agency. There were

alumni around who encouraged us to race the last team's car, because

they thought we would race better that way. Not true; we wouldn't have

retained any members! We built the first ground-up new car in 5 years

(and the first off new molds in 9 years). We found that it was very

important to build a new car. We also built a strong team, composed of

people who were good personal friends, which paid off richly 2 years

later. The race itself was mostly a disaster; the only good thing that

came of it was our resolve that we would do better next time (more

test miles and a more modest set of technical challenges).

* In the 03-05 cycle, things went infinitely better than 01-03. We set

an explicit goal (Win NASC 2005) and wrote it on the board, where it

stayed for 2 years. Below it, we wrote down 3 enabling sub-goals: log

1500 pre-race test miles, participate in early qualifiers, and carry

out all scrutineering tests in advance. Those stayed on the board too.

We carved off manageable amounts of work, AND WE SENT OUT AS MUCH

FABRICATION WORK AS POSSIBLE -- chassis to a welding shop, molds to a

composites shop, array encapsulation to an array guy, metal fab to a

slew of machinists. Etc. All this enabled us to get on the road sooner

and focus on making a ridiculously robust car and team.

We set explicit goals, like a Central Valley-drivable car by April 1

before the race, which we managed to pull off. After we started

driving it, we improved it (and learned to race as a team). We

iterated furiously on already-built hardware. We practiced tire

changes and roadside flagging. We made 4 checklists (mechanical,

electrical, body, and driver/preflight), which we carried out every

day of testing and racing. We ACTUALLY got 1800 test miles on the car

before the start of the race, which was really what allowed us to

succeed. We knew we had been successful when after the first day of

the race in '05, a first-time member commented: "This is kind of

boring, it feels just like valley drives."

We ended up winning the race (stock class), which was awesome -- but

more importantly, we raced the car to its potential and our team ran

like clockwork. It helped that the people running the team was good

friends and had shared the failure of 2003 -- so we were all agreed on

the direction, and committed to making it succeed. And we got test

miles, which is the key.

What went poorly?

* In 01-03, we didn't know a thing about building cars, because the

team hadn't built one ground-up in 8 years. We bit off too much

technical work, we were too cocky, we didn't take seriously the

demands of the race rules, and we simply didn't have enough test miles

on the car or the team. We also didn't reach out particularly strongly

to recruit more solid members, and we also didn't fundraise

particularly successfully.

* In 03-05, we failed on a few fronts. Our design review process

wasn't as thorough as it should have been, which required lots of

iteration on already-built hardware. We didn't have a particularly

robust electronics package (at least compared to our mechanical and

body), which caused us some falters during the race. We also could

have been more effective fundraising, and there were a few

interpersonal divisions on the team that we didn't handle particularly

well.

What goals did you have for the team after your last race?

Mainly, longevity. What's right for the team changes over the years,

as does the interest of the average Stanford student, as does the

University's support of the Project. What worked well for us in 03-05

was buliding consensus that we would NOT reinvent the wheel at any

cost, we would get lots of testing in, and acting accordingly. I think

in the following years, as the team's composition changed (and the

available tools improved), it made more sense to invest time in what

we would have viewed as reinventing the wheel. For instance, we would

never have dreamed of building our own MPPTs. But, the team is only as

strong as the commitment of its all-volunteer member base, and the

all-volunteer member base will only stick around as long as it feels

engaged. What's right for the team depends on what the individual team

members want to do -- what will make people come back week after week

and sacrifice their academics for something they find more meaningful.

Thoughts from Ben on Testing

This is somewhat in response to the ‘Design Philosophy’ thread, but I think it’s generally a good time to have this discussion anyway.

&#x20;

This email is absolutely not intended to discourage test drives. We all think that it’s great that you’ve started so early, and hope that you continue to put many miles on the car.

&#x20;

Testing is hard

&#x20;

When you run a test, you should be thinking about these things:

\-          What am I trying to learn from running this test?

\-          Does this test correctly envelope the operating conditions that I expect to see?

\-          Are there other factors that can impact this test? E.g. temperature, humidity, road quality, speed?

\-          Am I testing for long enough duration/frequently enough/on enough parts?

And crucially

\-          What analysis do I need to do before/after I run the test?

&#x20;

&#x20;

Here’s an example

&#x20;

This is a failure that (I believe) Forrest North told me about. They had run a bunch of tests on the array in California, and everything looked great. When they got to Australia everything shorted out. It turned out that they had gotten a small amount of carbon dust into the wiring. It hadn’t been a problem in California, but when they got to Australia they were getting 20% more energy (thanks CFCs), and this was enough to cause the harness to short out.

[CFCs](https://mail.spacex.com/owa/redir.aspx?C=rngeapUt4EGocSrZx_2Yl48jsvM_mNIIcomfUO5RPcTGWu1tBUstTCjqmp1UP_a9TGlD81-7q9c.\&URL=https%3a%2f%2fen.wikipedia.org%2fwiki%2fOzone_depletion%23Ozone_hole_and_its_causes)

&#x20;

The lesson is this: no matter how many test drives they did in California, they wouldn’t have uncovered this issue. However, it is relatively straightforward to construct a test that would have revealed the issue.

&#x20;

Yes, this is a relatively obscure problem, and yes it’s possible that it would have slipped through even with rigorous testing. But the more you think about your system, and the more you test individual components as well as the system as a whole, the more likely you are to uncover these issues and fix them ahead of time.

&#x20;

&#x20;

&#x20;

In conclusion, testing is hard

&#x20;

It’s great that you are already putting miles on the car, and that you’ve embraced ‘test it again’ as a core principal. Time to really put that to work. Testing is hard- you need to come up with the test, you need to figure out what it tells you and what analysis you need to do. You need to make the time to run the test. Sometimes this means you need to acquire resources that you don’t already have (time on a vibe table, test harnesses, a large flat area). Sometimes you need to prioritize testing over building. Please don’t get to Australia with ‘Test it Again’ written on the side of the van and then lose time during the race due to failures that could have been tested for :).

Thoughts from Rachel

I highly recommend doing some reading on testing. Here are a few links to get you started:

\-- This page is on software testing, but the summary and limitations sections are worth reading. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit\_testing

[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit\_testing](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_testing)

\-- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Failure\_mode\_and\_effects\_analysis

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Failure\_mode\_and\_effects\_analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Failure_mode_and_effects_analysis)

\-- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Failure\_analysis

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Failure\_analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Failure_analysis)

\-- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reliability\_engineering

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reliability\_engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reliability_engineering)

None of these will tell you what to test and how to test it, because that varies from system to system.  These are intended to provide ways of thinking about testing and understanding what to test.

Some questions to get you started, for any person with ownership of a part or system of the car:

\-- What do I expect to see fail?

\-- What will that failure look like?

\-- What will distinguish that failure mode from other failure modes?

\-- What failure am I most afraid of during a test drive?  During the race?

\-- How will you measure success or failure of a test?  What are your metrics?  Fred Brooks in The Mythical Man-Month says: "Never go to sea with two chronometers; take one or three."\[7] Meaning, if two chronometers contradict, how do you know which one is correct?

+1 to all of Ben's questions as well.

Writing a test plan before you head out is also useful.  It forces you to think about the tests that you are trying to run before you have the whole team out there waiting on you.  Having a good plan also means that if something goes wrong with the software\* (e.g. cruise control doesn't work) you have a list of other tests (braking, acceleration, slalom, etc) that you can run while the coders are working.  Again, this is better than sitting on your hands or yelling at your code team.
