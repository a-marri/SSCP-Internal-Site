# Alumni Advisory Board Meeting December 15, 2012

Here were the big points from this yesterday's meeting. Let me know if you want more details about any of these.

* Design for simplicity and test it wellMake sure you know how your car will perform in the rain. How does power consumption change? Will the array short?Recommended kevlar or fiberglass for the top shellGet a professional weatherman to travel with us to give us definitive weather updates while we are in the OutbackTalk to Mark Scheeff about strategy. Having a well parameterized model is more important than having an elegant or complex model. We need to have a basic understanding of the car's performance early in our testing phase.Every person in Australia should have their own personal toolbox with the things they needWe shouldn't just rely on glue fillets on our battery box. We should do fiberglass layups over our corners of the battery box. The box is too flexible right now.We could get away with only using one motor since we rarely need regen in the Outback. We could just disable regen. However, having two motors in the car means that we always have a backup motor installed.We should probably machine our uprights for the NGM before we machine uprights for the custom motor that way we ensure that we actually have a backup readyThey pushed us to put the drive motors in the rear wheels to reduce wire fatigue and complexity in the front.We should use GH Craft rims if at all possibleWhile we are all in So Cal we should find and meet a guy named Al Taconi who works(ed) at AC PropulsionSomeone should restore our second NGM now

Make sure you know how your car will perform in the rain. How does power consumption change? Will the array short?

Recommended kevlar or fiberglass for the top shell

Talk to Mark Scheeff about strategy. Having a well parameterized model is more important than having an elegant or complex model. We need to have a basic understanding of the car's performance early in our testing phase.

Every person in Australia should have their own personal toolbox with the things they need

We shouldn't just rely on glue fillets on our battery box. We should do fiberglass layups over our corners of the battery box. The box is too flexible right now.

We could get away with only using one motor since we rarely need regen in the Outback. We could just disable regen. However, having two motors in the car means that we always have a backup motor installed.

We should probably machine our uprights for the NGM before we machine uprights for the custom motor that way we ensure that we actually have a backup ready

They pushed us to put the drive motors in the rear wheels to reduce wire fatigue and complexity in the front.

We should use GH Craft rims if at all possible

While we are all in So Cal we should find and meet a guy named Al Taconi who works(ed) at AC Propulsion

Someone should restore our second NGM now
