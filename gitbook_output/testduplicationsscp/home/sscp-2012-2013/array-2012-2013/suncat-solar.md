In 2012 the team requested a quote from Alain Chuzzel for array encapsulation. Here is the resulting conversation

Wesley,

&#x20;

I'm afraid it would be impossible for me to get an array to you by the start of March.  The second array by the start of May is not out of the question but to be completely frank, I can't commit to it yet as I'm trying to give some of my repeat customers some "grace time" to commit to me.  If at least one doesn't, the schedule opening it would create could be yours if we agree on pricing/terms.

&#x20;

With the above in mind, and presuming you're still interested, we could still work on evaluating the performance of FEP and Reflekt with my EVA if you could supply the cells/interconnects.

&#x20;

Regarding ballpark pricing, for 7 m^2 using your cells/interconnects, think in terms of $30 to $35 per full C60.  Diode related materials and labor are more tricky so let me set that aside for now.  Generally, other than the cells and possibly diodes, I don't bother with the costs of the other materials when working up quotes.  I suppose I could take some time to come up with a "discount" for these other materials you provide but my best guess is that it would be quite minimal on a per cell basis.

&#x20;

Regards,

&#x20;

Hi Alain,

I think getting a side by side comparison would be helpful for our team. Our friends at Sunpower suggested that adding a white back sheet would make a statistically significant improvement in our array performance, so I would at least like to know how your stack compares to our stack with the Reflekt back sheet? I don't think we have time for an NREL test, but we have a good relationship with a local photovoltaics company that could do tests for us. Alternatively, we could do a basic test with our equipment at our shop. We could make a module using our method with Sunpower C60 bin I or bin J cells. Do you have those cells in stock to make a sample module for us to compare? We could also send you a few of our cells for you to encapsulate as a sample for us if you don't have those particular cell bins available.

What fraction of your final quote cost comes from the cost of encapsulation materials? If we decide to have you encapsulate one or two of our arrays we would hopefully save some amount by giving you the materials that we already sourced when we were planning on encapsulating our own array. I presume we will give you cells, diodes, and tabs; the question is who provides the top sheet, back sheet and EVA.

The option of using our FEP, our Reflekt, our cells and your EVA might work well. Do you think you could give us a ballpark quote based on that option?

We would need to have at least one array ready by the start of March to give us time to do road testing before our event. I think the second array could arrive as late as the start of May, but it would be super valuable to have it earlier if possible. Please let me know what that means for your schedule and pricing.

Cheers,

-Wesley

Toby,

&#x20;

Thanks for the detail.

&#x20;

Including the diodes, how "married" are you to all these materials?  What if I can offer something substantially thinner overall with similar, if not better, net cell performance?  As you may know, I've built numerous solar car arrays using some version of my ETFE/EVA/Circuit/EVA/ETFE lamination.  My latest "standard" includes customized encapsulation materials that come in at about 0.14 to 0.16 mm on each side of the circuit before encapsulation.

&#x20;

A note about "net cell performance" mentioned above.  I understand the idea behind the "Reflekt" and that the FEP material is marginally better in total solar transmission than ETFE so I'd be happy to help with a side by side evaluation so that you could make the most informed decision.  My bet is that the difference would be "in the noise".  Alternatively, after a test or two of my own to make sure the materials are compatible with my overall process, I could simply use the Reflekt and FEP with my, much thinner, EVA.

&#x20;

As you could imagine, since things are a little un-decided, quoting is still difficult.  If you could give me a sense of your flexibility with the materials, I could then give you a "ball-park" kind of number.  Because of my schedule demands, would it be possible for you to let me know the latest you could receive each array?  Obviously, the later the better with respect to price.  We've been fortunate to have reasonably continuous non-solar car work but we try to leave some time for working with solar car teams.

Hi Alain,

I'm Toby and I'm a Stanford student that helps Wesley with the solar car and I have been leading the efforts to construct our latest array. We are interested in a quote for 7m^2 and 14m^2 array lamination, lead time, and start dates; but first, to answer your questions:

1. Our standard recipe on a clamshell laminator is at 140C.  We pump for 5.5 minutes, one minute to bring the diaphragm down, 16 minutes cure. We allow the array to cool under vacuum to prevent wrinkling. This results in a cross linking density of above 80%.

For a standard oven, we preheat the oven to 140C. Once the oven reaches 140C, we put the module in the oven and pull vacuum through a vacuum bag. We let the module sit in the oven under vacuum until an IR thermometer measures a module temperature of 110C. This takes the module about 25 minutes. After 25 minutes, we take the array out and let it cool under vacuum to 50C before breaking vacuum. We don't know the crosslinking density for a standard oven.

What type of oven do you have?

The EVA ought to be sealed in a bag with some desiccant. The EVA that we use is STR PHOTOCAP 15505P/UF The other materials do not require desiccant.

2.

The roll width of the EVA is 1060 mm. I imagine that we would send you 10m of it

I don't know the roll width of the Reflekt exactly but it is close to 1060mm. I can give you the exact number this weekend

We are getting a new roll of FEP, we are still working out the details of the final dimensions.

3\.&#x20;

The thickness of the FEP is 0.1mm

The thickness of the cells is 0.145 mm&#x20;

The uncured thickness of the EVA is 0.46 mm

The Reflekt is 0.245 mm thick

We would like to integrate bypass diodes into our array. We have chosen a diode and we are finalizing the CAD of the array tabs that the diodes http://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/STPS30L30DJF-TR/497-12867-1-ND/3043778 will use. Schematics of the panel and diode layout are attached to this email.&#x20;

Do you usually integrate your own bypass diodes in the arrays that you build?

If you want more information, feel free to email me at tobys@stanford.edu or call me at 650 427 9741.
