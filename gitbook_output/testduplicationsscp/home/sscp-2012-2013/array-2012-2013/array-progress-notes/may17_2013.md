Hi all,

Good news. The modules today came out with no wrinkles. The bad news is that I changed more than one variable, so I'm not quite sure what was causing the problems. The last two things that I changed were 1) moving the shelf back to the very top rack of the oven and 2) changing the bake cycle to 15 minutes at 150 degrees Celsius.

We had two wrinkle free modules, so I'm okay with doing bin K modules. I'll be in Denver starting on Sunday, but Greg and I are going to make one more push to see if Minnesota can spare some of their good 3M sheet. The new 3M sheet still causes the modules to warp.

Could the team for Saturday please make modules 26 and 18. This is a 1 x 4 and a 1 x 1.

The stack will be:

White peel ply taped on all four sides. 

Dupont FEP. Make sure you know which side faces out

EVA

Bin K cells

EVA

Madico Back Sheet

perforated release film

vacuum bag

Please put it on the top shelf

150 degrees for only 15 minutes. 

Thanks, 

We encapsulated 3 modules this way. one 1x5, and two 1x1 modules. We put them in the oven at 4:52pm for 15 minutes. We allowed the modules to slow cool in the oven. Matthew, Amy and Toby did most of the work. 

When we put the module in, after we had to open the door, the oven dropped to 65c.

after 15 minutes the tempeature was 118c
