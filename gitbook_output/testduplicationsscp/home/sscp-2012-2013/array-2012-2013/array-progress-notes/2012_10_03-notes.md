From Toby:

I think that the 2 most likely stacks that we would use would be FEP/EVA/cell/EVA/Madico Reflekt Backsheet or FEP/TPU/cell/TPU/Madico Reflekt Backsheet and, if we have time, it would be good to test them both. FEP is likely better than ETFE because of its higher transmission and better UV cutoff, see http://www2.dupont.com/Teflon_Industrial/en_US/assets/downloads/k23269_Teflon_films.pdf
