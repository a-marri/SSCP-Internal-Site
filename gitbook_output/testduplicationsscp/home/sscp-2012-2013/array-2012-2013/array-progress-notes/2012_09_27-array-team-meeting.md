* Since the last meeting the team has done more testing at D2, the main objectives of this study were to see which encapsulant works best. The results are here. ETFE with Saint Gobain along with STR EVA 4 is TPU. (ETFE/TPU/cell/TPU/Reflekt) This was the worse. TPU has better index matching, but Toby thinks that the transmission spectrum is slightly different than EVA. 5 is two ply ETFE / EVA from Saint Gobain  (2-ply/cell/EVA/Reflekt) , we would expect that this would not wrinkle, however, we still saw wrinkles. 6 STR Eva cell  (ETFE/EVA/cell/EVA/Reflekt) . Makes sense that this is better. It is thinner, transmission spectrum is better because the UV spectrum is further into the UVIt is likely that we will use the cell stack for #6, but, Pre lam is the efficiency of the cell by itselfpost lam is efficiency after lamination

* Things to try next time we're at D2 (likely in 2 weeks, they're pretty swamped) we should try without textured sheetUse Paul and Zubair's stretching jig to stretch the ETFE prior to laminationwe get wrinkling regardless of the texture of the release sheetSam was able to eliminate wrinkles, but we would pull vacuum before applying external pressure. However, Sam was using TPU not EVA as we are now. In D2's setup, the pressure and the vacuum are applied simultaneouslyThey pre-heat the chamber, so it is possible that the bottom layer gets tacked down to the hot surface causing wrinklingRemember to take photos during the layup stack so that we can remember the layup stack
