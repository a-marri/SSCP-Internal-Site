# 2012_09_10 Array Team Minutes

Toby and Erin did some tests at D2 solar, we made three modules. The module stacks were

1. ETFE from Saint Gobain / STR's EVA / SunPower cells / Madico Protekt Backsheet and EVA laminate

2. ETFE from Saint Gobain / STR's EVA / SunPower cells / Madico Protekt Backsheet and EVA laminate

3. 1. ETFE from Saint Gobain / Steven's Urethane TPU / SunPower cells / Madico Protekt Backsheet and EVA laminate

Module 1, experienced some bowing problems, @see picture1. To fix this, we taped the module's down in D2's laminator. Module 2 turned out much better. Modules 1 and 2 both had wrinkles. Using TPU helped, but didn't get rid of the wrinkles.

We have enough materials to make an array, but we it may not be the best so we want to get our hands on some AGC fluon top sheet, this top sheet is nice because it has a microtexture that should give us an advantage when the sun is low in the sky. We have AGC Fluon on the way. AGC Fluon would be good to have because it would provide texture without having to use a TPU top sheet like Apogee. Erin did some tests and found that TPU gets dirty really quickly and can decrease the current by 20% @

Saint Gobain has an ETFE / EVA laminate that might help our wrinkling problems. I would be nice to get STR's EVA because it has a better response in the UV.

It's important to know how much these cells bend before they breakÂ  Erin is working on a test jig that can bend the cells. She plans on capturing the cracks using a hacked webcam. The webcam can capture the IR radiation to detect dead spots

NREL sent us data from long-term module testing on our module as well as UM's and Suncat Olivia looked at this data and found that our modules perform the same as a function of incident sunlight and temperature. UM's cells perform worse and we suspect that this is from the dicing and enhanced recombination that occurs as the temperature increases and carrier concentration increases

Below is a list of the tasks that we outlined and the people that agreed to take on the projects. I'm sure that some of the descriptions are unclear and incorrect so please let me know if you spot any errors.

- Measure the quantum efficiency of the modules [Toby]

- Calculate the efficiency difference between EVA and TPU taking into account index matching and transmission spectra [Olivia]

- Plot efficiency versus time and modify the temperature vs. efficiency data to account for radiance [Olivia]

- Write a blog post on our great partner, D2 solar [Toby]

- Talk to MicroLink Devices and find 1. What do they use as their topsheet, 2. If they use EVA or TPU 3. Where the texture on the ETFE top sheet should be, 4. Whether they can encapsulate for us 5. If they have had any issues with wrinkling [Paul]

- Build a stretching jig to help with wrinkling [Paul and Zubair]

- Find somebody, anybody, at 3M to get a sample of their frontsheet [Paul]

- Get 20 square meters of Saint Gobain EVA-ETFE laminate and STR EVA [Toby]

- Make a list of all of the things that we need for the next module i.e. tabs, ribbon, kapton, 3m command strip... [Paul]

- Update google site [Toby]
