Our goals for today were:

1. Get rid of the crease in the module by stretching out the peel-ply
2. Test the angular dependence of the current for solar cells with varying degrees of texture.
3. Take IR pictures with the sweet camera that Eric Thong donated to the array team.
4. Fix the oven

Here's what we did to meet them:

1. Paul, Miraj, Yuki, Amy, and Anna made 3 1x1 modules to solve the problem of wrinkles in our module. They tried a couple of different taping schemes. They also made a 1 x 1 module without texture to test the effect of texturing on performance at grazing incidence. It is important to keep in mind that the breather felt needs to touch all of the cells to get good vacuum. The best taping scheme was #3 which involved putting double-sided acrylic tape around the edge.
2. Matthew and Toby worked on testing the angular dependence of the current. We tested several types of texture and we found that for all of the textures tested, there was no difference in current versus angle. we found that the craftsman, ac/dc clamp meter was the most accurate and we could measure  5.7A from one of the cells. The data from our test is attached to this page.&#x20;
3. Eric Thong and I took some great pictures with the camera that Eric hacked and a little magic from lightroom. You can find the pictures at https://sites.google.com/a/stanfordsolarcar.com/sscp/home/array/ir-camera

4. NHS and Sasha did a great job and fixed our oven! Yes!

&#x20;

Stuff we need:

Sasha to teach us how to solder properly&#x20;

New sheet metal to help cut the large, 4x5 modules

Ribbed peel ply without the ribs but still the same, hefty threads&#x20;

The actual stencils to layout the cells&#x20;

&#x20;&#x20;

Stuff that we'll to do next Saturday

* cut the sheet metal to size (assuming that we have it)
* perform the angle test on an un-textured surface
* learn to solder correctly
* solder and encapsulate a real module that will go on the actual car

&#x20;

Random Notes

1707: put modules in the oven when it reached a temperature by the oven thermostat of 130C, it took me a while to put the stuff in the oven and the temperature dropped to 110C.&#x20;

&#x20;

matthew, eric, anna helped with making measurements of current as a function of angle&#x20;

* we found that the craftsman, ac/dc clamp meter was the most accurate and we could measure  6.25A from one of the cells when the current
