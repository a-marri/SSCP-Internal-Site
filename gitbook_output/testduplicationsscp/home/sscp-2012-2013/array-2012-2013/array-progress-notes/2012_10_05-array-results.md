## 2012\_10\_05 Array Results

All encapsulants were cut this day using straight edges and calipers. In the future the team will use a template to repeatedly cut material to the correct size.

### 3x1 Array with TPU

FEP: 129x380 mm

TPU: 128x379 mm

Cell

TPU: 128x379 mm

Madilo: 129x380 mm

Oven set to 120 C

Cells were removed once they reached 116 C, after \~50 minutes

TPU flowed over by \~1 mm

Cells were not completely encapsulated, most likely shifted during vacuuming&#x20;

Ran current through cells

&#x20;   Cells heated up, TPU started to flow and wrinkle

&#x20;   Visible under IR light

&#x20;   (the next day the cells showed cracking after rough handling)

Module Weight: 86g

### 3x1 Array with EVA

FEP-Dupont: 129x380 mm

EVA- rough side facing cell: 128x379 mm

Cell

EVA- rough side facing cell: 128x379 mm

Madilo: 129x380 mm

Oven set to 150 C, brought down to 140 C, but temperature stayed at 120-125 C

Cells were removed once they reached 120 C

EVA stuck to backsheet, had to be ripped off

EVA flowed over by \~3-4mm

Cells were completely encapsulated

&#x20;   Visible under IR light

&#x20;   (the next day the cells showed cracking after rough handling)

Module Weight: 83g (

### 2x2 Array with EVA

FEP-Dupont: 256x256mm (125mm per cell, 1mm in between each cell, and 2.5mm on each side)

EVA- smooth side facing cell: 253x253mm

Cell

EVA- smooth side facing cell: 253x253mm

Madilo: 256x256mm

### Notes on Module Weight

Xenith's modules weighed 686g each for a combined array weight of 26\*686=17.836Kg

The 1x3 EVA module weighed 86g for a combined weight of 8&#x36;_&#x35;_&#x32;6=11.180

Dropping glass as an encapsulant saves 14.77lbs

1x1 Array with EVA (sand paper test)

FEP: 130x130mm (125mm per cell, 2.5 mm on each side)

EVA--smooth side facing cell: 126x128mm (126mm to allow for 2mm flow on each side, and 128mm to allow for 1mm flow on each side)

Cell

EVA--smooth side facing cell: 126x128mm

Madilo: 130x130mm&#x20;

Sandpaper: 123x123mm (attempting to create rough pattern onto cell)

3x5 Array with EVA

FEP: 382x634mm

EVA: 378x630mm

Cell:&#x20;

EVA:

Madilo:&#x20;

Temperature: 133 C
