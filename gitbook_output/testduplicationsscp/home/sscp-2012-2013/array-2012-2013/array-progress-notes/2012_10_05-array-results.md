# 2012_10_05 Array Results

All encapsulants were cut this day using straight edges and calipers. In the future the team will use a template to repeatedly cut material to the correct size.

## 3x1 Array with TPU

[](#h.5yh0fasj633)

FEP: 129x380 mm

TPU: 128x379 mm

Cell

TPU: 128x379 mm

Madilo: 129x380 mm

Oven set to 120 C

Cells were removed once they reached 116 C, after ~50 minutes

TPU flowed over by ~1 mm

Cells were not completely encapsulated, most likely shifted during vacuuming 

Ran current through cells

    Cells heated up, TPU started to flow and wrinkle

    Visible under IR light

    (the next day the cells showed cracking after rough handling)

Module Weight: 86g

## 3x1 Array with EVA

[](#h.zbt40fdoi6oe)

FEP-Dupont: 129x380 mm

EVA- rough side facing cell: 128x379 mm

Cell

EVA- rough side facing cell: 128x379 mm

Madilo: 129x380 mm

Oven set to 150 C, brought down to 140 C, but temperature stayed at 120-125 C

Cells were removed once they reached 120 C

EVA stuck to backsheet, had to be ripped off

EVA flowed over by ~3-4mm

Cells were completely encapsulated

    Visible under IR light

    (the next day the cells showed cracking after rough handling)

Module Weight: 83g (

## 2x2 Array with EVA

[](#h.les0uqnt7dx7)

FEP-Dupont: 256x256mm (125mm per cell, 1mm in between each cell, and 2.5mm on each side)

EVA- smooth side facing cell: 253x253mm

Cell

EVA- smooth side facing cell: 253x253mm

Madilo: 256x256mm

## Notes on Module Weight

[](#h.ab0iem7sg8qs)

Xenith's modules weighed 686g each for a combined array weight of 26*686=17.836Kg

The 1x3 EVA module weighed 86g for a combined weight of 86*5*26=11.180

Dropping glass as an encapsulant saves 14.77lbs

1x1 Array with EVA (sand paper test)

FEP: 130x130mm (125mm per cell, 2.5 mm on each side)

EVA--smooth side facing cell: 126x128mm (126mm to allow for 2mm flow on each side, and 128mm to allow for 1mm flow on each side)

Cell

EVA--smooth side facing cell: 126x128mm

Madilo: 130x130mm 

Sandpaper: 123x123mm (attempting to create rough pattern onto cell)

3x5 Array with EVA

FEP: 382x634mm

EVA: 378x630mm

Cell: 

EVA:

Madilo: 

Temperature: 133 C
