# 2012_11_10 November 10 Progress Notes 2012

- Sasha showed Yuki, me, and Paul D. how to solder. Sasha prefers to use the solder pump and the solder paste. His method is really cool and he strongly advises against using our current method of solder wire

- John bolander, sasha, and I, have decided to use this diode as the array bypass diode. We will put one of these diodes at the end of each solder string. The digikey part number for the diode is 497-12867-1-ND. We like this diode because of it's profile, it looks like it will be easy to solder, and because it has a very low turn-on voltage.Â 

- Yuki, Erin, and Paul D. made a sweet box for us to store our arrays! Nice work!

- Matthew Matera, and his friend Alexander started to make a vacuum jig that will help us hold the solar cells down while we solder them. The parts that are missing from the solder jig are the medium density fiberboard, liquid nails to make the box leakproof, and the track halogen lamps to keep the soldering table warm. Greg is getting the fiberboard and liquid nails when he goes to home depot tuesday.

- Paul D, Yuki and Erin found that texture helps to improve the current when the light is hitting the module at a grazing incidence. The amount of texture doesn't really matter, so long as there is texture.

To do:

- print out stencil for laying out solar cells prior to soldering [Greg H]

- finish the vacuum soldering box jig thingy [Matthew Matera Toby Greg]

- Design interconnect tabs to accomodate the new diodes [????]
