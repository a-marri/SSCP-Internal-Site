# 2012_12_1_ArrayTeamNotes

Present: Amy, Erin, Yuki, Miraj, Lisette, Matthew

Yuki and Miraj began working on writing a technical document detailing how to make a module. Since we don't have the soldering box done yet, they just started on writing how exactly they lay-up the cell stack (EVA / Peel Ply / etc....) They have a rough outline right now that is similar to the one that Paul Chen made. They plan on filling this in with actual pictures, one step per instruction. They have not started on the soldering portion because we have yet to use the soldering jig.

Amy cut out some foam for the box that we will use to store the arrays. This will prevent shifting of the array components during storage.

Erin and Toby worked on the placement of array bypass diodes and how they will fit inside of the module

Yuki and Miraj cut some metal stencils for the 4 x 5 solar modules.Â 

We plan on meeting again on Dec. 14 to make and document the creation of a module that will go on the actual solar car

Everybody but Toby will be at Stanford over the break. If there is one other person here... we can start making modules together....

To do by Dec 14

- Complete documentation on the lay-up process [Miraj and Yuki]

- Finish the soldering jig [Matthew and Erin]

- Draw the new end tabs that will accommodate the bypass diodes [Erin]

- Write to Dupont so that we can have plenty of FEP for when full production begins [Toby]
