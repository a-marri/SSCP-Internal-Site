# 2012_10_20_3x5testEncapsulation

Objective: 

1. Attempt to encapsulate a 3 x 5 modules

2. Encapsulste a 1x1 module to examine the effect of texture

Observations:

- We need some IPA, Large gloves, solder paste (smd 4300SNL10 35 GRAMS Sn 96.5/3Ag/.5Cu Luer lok tip

-  also need ammo box

1335 Paul thinks that the cells he solders are not aligned because of the cell dicers, not lack of stencil. 

1400 Put 1 x 1 module in the oven, the oven temperature dropped from 130c to 110C, 

1425 Took module out, to let it cool, according to the IR thermometer, it was at 117C, the oven was at 130C and the 

(Time)

When the module dropped to 33C, I took off the vacuum bag. The  

Put 3x5 cell (with outer dimensions of 382x634mm and 4mm to EVA) in the oven
