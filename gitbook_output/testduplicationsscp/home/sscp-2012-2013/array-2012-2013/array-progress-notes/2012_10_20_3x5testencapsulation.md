## 2012\_10\_20\_3x5testEncapsulation

Objective:&#x20;

1. Attempt to encapsulate a 3 x 5 modules
2. Encapsulste a 1x1 module to examine the effect of texture

Observations:

* We need some IPA, Large gloves, solder paste (smd 4300SNL10 35 GRAMS Sn 96.5/3Ag/.5Cu Luer lok tip

\-  also need ammo box

1335 Paul thinks that the cells he solders are not aligned because of the cell dicers, not lack of stencil.&#x20;

1400 Put 1 x 1 module in the oven, the oven temperature dropped from 130c to 110C,&#x20;

1425 Took module out, to let it cool, according to the IR thermometer, it was at 117C, the oven was at 130C and the&#x20;

(Time)

When the module dropped to 33C, I took off the vacuum bag. The &#x20;

Put 3x5 cell (with outer dimensions of 382x634mm and 4mm to EVA) in the oven
