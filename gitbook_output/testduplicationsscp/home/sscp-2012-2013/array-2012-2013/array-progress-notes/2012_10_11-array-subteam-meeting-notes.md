# 2012_10_11 array subteam meeting notes

Here's a summary of what we talked about at today's array team meeting.

- The array team fixed the wrinkling problem, we suspect having the array cooling under vacuum is critical

- We bent a 2 x 2 module over the curviest part of the car and found that the module does not crack. The before and after pictures can be found here

- Based on our UV-Vis results, we found that STR-EVA has the largest window into the UV by 28nm. This buys us ~20W/m^2 worth of extra power or ~10% more power than we would have otherwise. This page has the calculation details. Erin has found that the gain from improving UV transmission is way higher than the gain from a better index match with TPU.

- Our final array stack that we will use for the car is Dupont FEP / STR EVA / cell / STR EVA / Madico Backsheet

- We don't have a need to go to D2 at this point because their existing setup cannot cool under vacuum 

- We are trying to upgrade our existing setup for making the modules by getting a nice ammo box for storing our cells, getting our solder paste station working again, etc. 

- We plan on sending a module to NREL to see what the effect of texture is

- Erin Antono and I starting to think about MPPT placement and wiring for the solar module. 

We will be meeting Saturday at 3pm to make a 3x5  module, and improve our technique. We will also begin designing the MPPT layout. 

Array to do 

Call dupont for more FEP [Toby]

Get more STR-EVA [Toby]

Use CAD to get printout of cells on card-stock [Erin]

Look into making a vacuum jig for lifting cells [Paul & Toby]

send cells to nrel [Toby]

get ammo box for storing our cells [Amy]

upgrade our solder setup for solder paste [Paul]

design mppt placement and wiring [Erin and Toby]
