Erin, Amy, and Toby Present

- Erin and Amy put the handles on the box that we will use to store cells

- Erin and Amy Cut a stencil for the EVA

Made a 4 x5 module

- wesley recommends putting tape on individual cells to make them structurally more stable

The 4 x 5 fit in the oven just fine. I kind of screwed up peeling the module from the substrate. 

Made a new checklist for the new array. See the front page of the array site. 

 Our array didn't have many cracks, which is good. It looks like all of the cells were hooked up correctly too.
