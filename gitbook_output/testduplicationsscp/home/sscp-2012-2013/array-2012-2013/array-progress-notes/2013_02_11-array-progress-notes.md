# 2013_02_11 Array Progress Notes

Hi guys and gals,

The panel from Monday had quite a few major issues.

1) It looks like all of the acrylic tape residue on the substrate glass wasn't scraped off, so the module has a bunch of deep patterns on the top layer. Please make sure you scrape all of the remaining peel ply off the substrate glass and clean the surface with rubbing alcohol before you start.

2) Someone forgot to cut slots in the EVA and Madico back sheet to let the tabs pop through. When the electrical tabs aren't exposed we basically have to throw away the module

3) The EVA flowed and stuck to the peel ply and breather. Usually this isn't the end of the world, but it means that we have to either A) prevent the EVA from sticking by putting cheap FEP on both sides of the module so it doesn't stick to the peel ply and breather or B) be extremely careful removing the module from the substrate glass. Using razor blades isn't ideal. If you cut the peel ply from the acrylic tape you can often tug on the peel ply straight out to break the peel ply form the substrate glass and EVA. However, this is kind of risky because you can easily rip the module or break cells if you aren't careful. If you choose option B work slowly and don't use a lot of force. If you have to use razor blade be absolutely certain that you aren't cutting the module. I know we had a few brand new people working on modules today, and the module edges were really really ragged. The aero team will be sad if we try to use ragged edged modules on the car. Ideally all of the modules would have perfectly straight edges and we would space modules 10-20 thousands of an inch apart on the car to leave really small seams.

4) Please don't forget to write the module specifications for the day on the back of the Madico before you encapsulate. If we don't pull modules out of the oven immediately after they cool it will be easy to forget exactly what cells, exactly what top sheet we used, and exactly what date we made the module.

5) I would recommend not leaving the module in the oven more than overnight. It would be a sad day if someone else on the team needed to bake a carbon part in the oven for 6 hours while your module was still in the oven. It is easy to overlook the module on the top shelf, and they would overheat your EVA. Ideally someone should come in the morning after a module finishes to remove it from the oven and carefully pack it. Don't forget to tape down the tabs before you put them in the box.

I have three other recommendations.

1) I'd like you guys to religiously follow the check list for making modules. Given that your team wants to divide the process of making one module into multiple shifts it is really easy for the team to overlook steps on the checklist during the shift changes. If the first shift assumes the second shift will cut holes for the tabs to pop through and the second shift assumes the first shift already cut slits for the tabs to pop through then no one will cut slits and we have to throw away the module. I updated the checklist a bit and printed a few copies for each module. Please make sure you indicate the date of each module's build on the checklist, initial your name next to each step you complete, and when we finish the module tape the checklist to the backside of the module before you put it in the box. Please actually print hard copies of the checklist and check off each step with a pen. Although using the checklist may seem like a hassle I guarantee it will save you time and many wasted cells in the long run.Â  If you miss any one item on the check list we will have to throw the module away. Monday's module was a throw away module for multiple reasons, and using the check list could have saved you all 6 or 7 hours of everyone's wasted time.

2) I think we should try using the cheap FEP as a release agent to prevent the EVA from sticking to the peel ply or the breather. If we end up using the 3M top sheet we won't be concerned about providing surface texture, so we should have few issues with placing FEP between the peel ply and the top sheet. The one issue is that the FEP is one of the few expensive materials that our team has to purchase with our own cash. If you can easily peel the FEP off the module after it bakes and the FEP is still clean with no remaining EVA residue we can reuse it for the next module.

3) Avoid letting brand new members work on array encapsulation from this point forward. We are actually cutting it kind of close on the number of bin K cells we have remaining, so we have absolutely zero room for mistakes once we start using bin K cells. Last year Nathan asked Paul, Sasha, and me to did all of the soldering and encapsulating for all of the modules to avoid the risk of unexperienced people making accidental mistakes. It would be tragic if had a module turn out like last Mondays' module with bin K cells.

You all have been making awesome progress with module encapsulation so far! The 3M top sheet should be here on Tuesday or Wednesday, and after a few modules of testing with the new top sheet we should be able to start on bin K cells!

Cheers,

-Wesley
