In the top shell of sunbad, there are channels that are 1" across that accomodate the array ribbons. The ribbons from each module will be bussed down to one end of the top shell where they will be connected to the battery pack.

Each individual module has 2 bypass diodes. Engineering design and CAD compliments of Erin Antono
