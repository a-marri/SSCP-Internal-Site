The team used 3M VHB 4926. This was a grey and black colored 0.015" tape. It stuck well to surface master and TPU.

Note that the team discovered that silicone products that release acetic acid during curing will corrode copper wiring. The 3M marine silicone that we used in 2013 caused corrosion on our copper wiring. However silicone that releases alcohol during curing could cause the EVA to delaminate.

The team used white GE Silicone II to seal the array. Other options considered included: 

* Look at Locktite 5620Better silicone  Examples of non-corrosive RTV silicone pastes are:  clear or gray Dow Corning 3145; white General Electric RTV 162 or gray high strength RTV 167; and clear Loctite 5140. General Electric RTV-11 is a white two part pourable RTV silicone rubber that is readily available from electronics distributors.  Dow Corning 3110 is roughly equivalent to GE RTV-11. General Electric Silicone II is the best we have found (releases Acetic Acid
