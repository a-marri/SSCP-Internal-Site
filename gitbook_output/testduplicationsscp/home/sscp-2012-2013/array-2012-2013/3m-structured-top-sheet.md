# SSCP - 3M Structured Top Sheet

# 3M Structured Top Sheet

The 3M top sheet collects more dirt than a similar ETFE top sheet. Gentle blowing removes significantly more dust on EFTE than on the 3M sheet. Using Windex seems to remove a lot more dust. However, you should always use a lint free cloth to clean the 3M top-sheet. Regular cotton or paper towels will leave lint behind in the channels of the top sheet.

The 3M sheet comes in a roll with one backing film. The film faces the mico structured riblets of the 3M sheet. The 3M sheet will have two strips of thin un-coated material along the side of the film. You will need to cut the 3M film so you don't use the section of the film that is thin. This part does not have the riblets on it.Â 

We did a comparison test between the 3M sheet and our ETFE in February 2013. The test was under relatively clear skies with the sun at a ~50% angle of incidence. The cells were placed on the ground. The remaining layup stack for both cells was (top sheet) EVA, cells, EVA, Madico Reflekt back-sheet. Both cells were encapsulated while being sandwiched between two sheets of ETFE to prevent the EVA from sticking to the peel ply. The peel ply was placed against the surface of the glass providing texture on the ETFE, but no noticeable texture on the 3M top sheet. After the test (results attached) the performance gain of the 3M sheet with the riblets aligned with the sun compared to the ETFE was positive but statistically insignificant (sample size of 1). When the riblets were orthogonal to the sun the short circuit current gain was 5.2%

The 3M top sheet appears to have a non uniform thickness. The sheet has ~1cm wavelength waves that run parallel to the roll of the sheet. Since the 3M sheet only has peel ply between it and the substrate glass the EVA flows to fill in the small amplitude waves, and the resulting 3M surface is flat.
