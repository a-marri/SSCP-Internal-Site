Chassis design review with Vivian and John (I came in on the tail end of this conversation...)

Concerned about complexity of internal chassis. There is

Vivian likes that unibody is one shot. Likes that mount points are in shear

Talk to Chris Gerdes about shock dimensions

What matters the most is getting adequate travel from the suspension

Remember to make sure that there won't be interferences

A unibody may simplify composites to some degree, but we will spend a lot of time trying to get carbon to conform to our tight radius curves

Thinks that roll bar is okay, but we don't have an answer for core/carbon layering plan. Vivian says add core along the arch of the roll bar. Add vertical stiffeners in the open space under the arch of the roll bar. Have a stiffener supporting from forces coming from the front.

Make sure we have a plate at any interface of core and tube. Don't just fish mouth tube and butt it against core.

If we put tubes in at all then have a roll cage that is entirely built with tubes. Don't mix to create a redundant design.

Have ribs within the roll cage to have adequate load transfer from front high points to lower points.

Forest suggested laying up metal tubing into the roll cage.&#x20;

John says don't reinvent the wheel. Inserts are fine. They are all over the 787 Vivian says. We don't have to co-mold necessarily.&#x20;

Vivian: it will take a while to do fillets etc.

John, cut and fold works well and then add layers where you need more layers.

Vivian: "would you say hell noâ€¦" John, no you can keep working on it

Do some crash testing. You will make assumptions about which panels will break first. Do your math to estimate where things should fail. Then see if they fail in the right places.

Friday nights work well for design reviews with Vivian and John

Don't forget to model torsional loads on your chassis caused by suspension bumping.&#x20;

I-beams are good at torsion

Do more free body diagrams, do free body diagrams for torsion too

We can CNC our core.&#x20;

"Nathan said you can do it without core" Vivian and John shriek in horror. "do not want"

We need to start with a more broad approach to our designs. And then debate and narrow down on one design

Went into too much depth with the chassis design before assessing it

Take a step back

Vivian on injection molding

Alljack: need a two week lead time. They are from asia

Model Solutions: is also good for injection molding

Vivian has contacts

Chassis you like: Vivian: carbon work on Equinox. John, Michigan 3 or 5?
