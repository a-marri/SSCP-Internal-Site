### Notes on Composite Testing

The first step in building any composite structure should be to test your materials and construction techniques to failure. Note: Materials testing and validation is NOT AN OPTIONAL STEP for composite construction. Until you validate and understand all of the mechanical properties of the materials you are working with, you have no idea what appropriate loading parameters are and there is no way to safely proceed with design. If you do not have the resources, knowledge, or time to do extensive material testing, you should not be building a composite chassis.

#### Mandatory Tests

1. Bending Strength of Panels
2. Tensile Strength of Glue per Inch of Panel with a fixed fillet
3. Maximum Bending Moment of a Joining
4. Pullout Strength of inserts on Panel with Glue
5. Shear Strength of Inserts on Panel with Glue
6. Front Seatbelt Mount Pull Strength
7. Core Bond Strength
8. Full carbon laminate stackup&#x20;
9. Maximum carbon thickness does not exotherm
