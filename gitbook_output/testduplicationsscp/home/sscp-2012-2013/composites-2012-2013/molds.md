## In Mold Locating Features

[](#h.eza2cincnqv1)

Conversation with Bayview:

We may CNC a pattern that may require a break in the tool (because of our CNC head may not be able to fit down into a tight area) when we machine it, but our customer requires an integral CNC pattern.

If the tolerances are not tight, we may do something as simple as matching scribes. (note: this is how Michigan did Quantum according to conversations with Santosh)

If the tolerances are tight, we may CNC matching  ½  female sphere’s, that are in alignment from one mold to the other.   Then we would set a tooling ball(s) in one tools pocket(s) and then set the accompanying tool in its proper position and the balls will align them very closely.   This is common in Aerospace tolerances.

 

If you are talking about hard molds….

We just built a Boat Hull that requires a tube cradle to create a form for the outer tube of the boat.  These are military RIB boats.  The tube cradle creates a lock in the tool, but we need to fab. the geometry in the hull so we need it to be removable.  In this case we CNC several male features on the flange of one tool & the same number of female features on the flange of the insert tool.  Both having the same geometry, when you set one on the other, they align.  These features may be a partial sphere, a trapezoid….

 

On some of our larger wind blade projects and a small proto tool that I currently have on-hand.  These are molds that are fabricated with a composite face sheet on a steel frame/support.  These tools required adjustable alignment in both transverse & longitudinal.  When they are adjustable, we would build the alignment feature off of the steel frame.   This is as simple as a V shape on one and the opposite on the other.  These can be set several down the length, 1 every 3 – 5 meters, then set some  in the transverse.

If it is a tight tolerance, the V blocks can be CNC’d. 

If not tight tolerances, you can use a std pc. of matching angle. 

These can both be made adjustable.

### Erik Hantsoo On Mold History

[](#h.65fagme1hyw9)

Indeed: MFG West made awesome molds for minimal price. Not sure what

their status is these days (the particular facility that made our

molds specialized in composite wind turbine nacelles, which I imagine

has gone mostly overseas by now -- but the MFG group of companies

makes everything from fiberglass cafeteria trays to automotive body

panels). The company is chaired by a Stanford alumnus, which was our

in.

Another option would be something closer to what we did for the

Back2Back Burner. A company up in Napa called Kreysler and Associates

machined low-density foam negative molds for us, which we then

fiberglassed and gelcoated (tremendously labor-intensive, on account

of both the foam we used and the resolution of their mill). Still,

going with Kreysler was useful for 2 reasons: it provided accurate

macroscopic shape for the molds (would have been infinitely harder

cutting 2D sections and filling), and it provided us with a

tremendously valuable contact in the composites industry. The guy who

owns it, Bill Kreysler, was the president of the leading composites

trade organization in the US, so he knows the industry in and out.

Furthermore, his company built the Death Star, a bunch of Oldenburg

sculptures (including the giant bow and arrow in SF), and interiors at

the Ferry Building and the SF Symphony. Much can be learned from him

and his people. There's a lot we did wrong with that approach that

made it harder than it had to be. If you wind up pursuing that route,

I'm happy to give a rundown of recommended practices.

And a bit more history: the bodies for the Afterburner, Afterburner 2,

and Third Degree Burner all came off the same molds, which were

machined by a branch of Boeing up in Seattle. They were beautiful:

gelcoated, 5-axis milled high-density tooling foam bonded to 1-ton

billet aluminum pallets. But they shared the same issue that the B2B

molds had: no thermal stability. As soon as they got hot during bake,

differential CTE of the dissimilar materials in the mold caused them

to crack, so they wouldn't hold vacuum.

As such, a 2-step process is likely indicated, to allow monolithic

single-material negative molds. Someone can fabricate positive

patterns (out of whatever combination of materials they want), and

then someone else can do a room-temp wet fiberglass layup to get

negative molds off the patterns. Monolithic fiberglass won't have

thermal stability issues when curing prepreg at temperature.

## Why we don't make our own molds:

[](#h.48hm36ckv01s)

Transcript of a conversation Nathan HS had with Jonathan Cook (Northwestern Team Member) April 2012

dude, our composites process is a mess

Jonathan

well, its really just that our molds have been really difficult

Jonathan

well, we were gonna do our top on a foam mld

and our bottom on a fiberglass mold, made off a foam plug

issues: 1) The foam plug didn't seal with paste wax, which we were told it would, so we had to chisel the foam off of our fiberglass mold

Jonathan's new status message - just 1 more final!   2:40 PM

so that was a mess

which resulted in damage to the fiberglass mold, which we had to repair by using the extra surfacing epoxy as a filler

which was ok until we ran out

we also decided then to coat everything in a thin layer of surfacing epoxy, to cover all the bad surface finish from the foam

but we ran out of surfacing epoxy during that

and didn't plug up all the holes properly

plus now we didn't have a smooth layer  of surfacing epoxy because it flowed and didn't spread very well

so we had to sand for like a week and a half

to get everything pretty good

and we bought some high-temp bondo to fix the other stuff

then we put it in the oven to post-cure

and when we pulled it out there were problems

some cracking, some warping, and we think it delaminated in some places

so there were big areas that were kinda bubbled up

so we fixed the cracks and stuff with more bondo

oh, and we had plastic soda bottle caps in our fiberglass mold layup, because they'd give us access to the foam layer underneath so we could spray in water/air to pop the mold off

but that was useless because the fiberglass stuck to the foam too well

anyways, those bottle caps didn't handle 350F, so we had to drill those out this week and repair the holes with bondo

now we've got a few spots where we think the fiberglass mold is leaking, so we can't pull a good vacuum

but we're going to put on this surfacing primer (ChemTrend MPP 2180), which is great stuff and fills in all the microporosity and after 6+ coats it seals for a vacuum

yeah, so that's the fiberglass mold

the foam one didn't have a great surface

it was good

so we sanded it

but after the fibeglass de-molding disaster...

## Receiving The Molds

[](#h.jdl37mqgwrd)

In the future the team should try to use the loading dock at EH&S across the street. Scope out the dock and make sure you can get access to the dock before you plan on using it. There is a chance that the dock may be too small. 

If the team can't use the EH&S loading dock the team's other options probably require a forklift. Scott Sutton in MERL will gladly bring over a forklift from the ME department if you ask him. You can get a second larger forklift by making a request at Event Services. Event Services does charge a fee. You can make a request here. 

[ Event Services](http://bgm.stanford.edu/groups/els/moving)

[ here](http://eventservices.stanford.edu/requests/index.cfm)

Check with the mold manufacturer to see if you need to post cure the molds and to seal the molds.

## Storing the Molds

[](#h.tclu6i6khlr2)

Eventually the VAIL admins will probably ask you to relocate the molds from VAIL. If you talk to Stanford Parking and Transportation Services you can request a permit to store the molds in one of the parking garages. Ta"Brown, Dwight" <dwight2@stanford.edu>, "Roberts, Jared" <jaredr@stanford.edu>, or the current Parking Operations Supervisor (parkingoperations@lists.stanford.edu). The team has previously stored molds in Parking Garage 6 and Parking Garage 5. If you can stack the molds on top of each other you can fit them in one parking spot usually.
