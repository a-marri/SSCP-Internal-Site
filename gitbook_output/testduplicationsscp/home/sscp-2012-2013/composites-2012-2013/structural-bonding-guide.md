This guide covers the bonding of various structural materials with carbon/epoxy matrix components. 

This guide only covers structural bonds - bonds intended to take safety critical high forces, such as those in a suspension, driver restraint, drivetrain, battery, or steering system. Materials omitted from this guide have either not been tested or are not considered to be structural.

## Bonding Chemistry Overview

Epoxy Bonding Theory

Epoxy makes a number of different types of bonds during the curing process. The mechanism that epoxy uses to bond is an area of active research, and varies by material. As relevant to this article, epoxy will bond materials which have high surface energy. If a material does not have high surface energy, then operations are undertaken to increase the surface energy of the material being bonded. In general, the surface energy of a material can be determined with a quick internet search. However, it can also be determined experimentally with a drop of de-ionized water. If the drop beads up, then the 

[ high surface energy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_energy)

material is low surface energy. If it pulls flat and wets the surface, then the material is high surface energy.

Epoxy normally only makes ionic and Van der Waals bonds with stainless and titanium. Epoxy will not form covalent bonds with Stainless or Titanium. Epoxy will absorb moisture, and the internal stress will crack the bond. The glue joint will "pop" in high moisture. This is very bad, and likely to happen in Darwin.

Epoxy bonds are affected negatively during application and curing by: moisture, oil, dust, grit. Epoxy bonds are affected negatively after curing by moisture, brake fluid, thermal coefficient mismatch.

Most surface preparation compounds provide an interface layer to which epoxy can covalently bond. AC-130 (a Sol-gel), phosphoric acid anodizing, and chromate conversion conversion coatings are all examples of coatings that use this principle. See the image to the right for some chemistry!

History of Aluminum Bonding at SSCP

Traditionally, SSCP has abraded the aluminum oxide layer off of aluminum, used MEK to remove sanding particles, and then glued to this. This works fine, but under humidity/water the oxide layer will creep back under the bond surface and cause the glue joint to crack/fail. This happened with glue joints on Apogee after 2-3 years. In particular, Apogee's door fell off in the prep for ASC 2010.

For Xenith, we used two different operations, phosphoric acid anodizing and West 860. Phosphoric acid anodizing, defined by a number of different military specs, is used by many manufacturers to provide a very strong, stable bonding surface. If a part has been phosphoric acid anodized, simply MEK the bonding surface, apply structural epoxy, install the part, and allow to cure. See "Alternative methods for surface preparation" below for engineering callout. West 860 is a two part chromic acid conversion coating. Step one chemically cleans the surface, Step 2 is chromic acid, which etches the surface and places chromium atoms inside the oxide layer, creating a "chromated primer surface." This allows the epoxy to covalently bond to the surface, forming a very strong bond. This is great, except for chromic acid is highly toxic/carcinogen, and cannot be disposed of easily. This is why we're switching to the below solution:

Warning: Normal aluminum anodizing is sulfuric acid based and can not be used on structurally bonded parts. (Handbook of Aluminum Bonding Technology and Data, Page 94)

## Alternative Methods for Surface Preparation for Aluminum

[](#h.qijkxuwilbuw)

There are a number of industry accepted methods for structural bonding of aluminum. "Section 2 Advanced Surface Prep" is the recommended practice for SSCP because of its low toxicity and ease of scheduling/coating. However, if there is more time available, then other techniques can be used. These are listed below.

### Chromic Acid Anodizing

[](#h.4nif8rn0uol)

![](../../../../assets/image_3f95517e4c.jpg)

Chromic Acid Anodizing is an an adequate substitute to the below process. It was used by TYE on the aluminum inserts for Xenith. If a part has been chromic acid anodized, simply IPA/MEK the bonding surface, apply structural epoxy, install the part, and allow to cure. Chromic acid anodizing makes excellent bonds but does not provide excellent corrosion protection like Alodine. This process is generally preferable for alloys with high magnesium content versus Alodine. If you want a part to be anodized with the proper materials for a strong, stable bonding surface, put this in the coating callout in the engineering drawing: ANODIZE PER MIL-A-8625 TYPE I, CLASS 1.

Note: this paragraph formerly recommended phosphoric acid anodizing, but listed the wrong specification. The datasheet for Xenith's inserts (TYE102 series aluminum) indicates that the inserts were actually chromic acid anodized, not phosphoric. Phosphoric acid anodizing was recommended by 3M as a surface prep method with a good shelf life (as apposed to AC130). If you still want to use phosphoric acid anodizing, reference the BAC5555 or ASTM D3933-98 standards.

### Alodine Type III and VI

[](#h.4vegkjbhdxuw)

Alodine is a surface coating process developed for aerospace that etches away the oxide coating on aluminum and replaces it with a chromated oxide. Epoxy and other adhesives will covalently bond to the chromium atoms, forming an excellent bond. This class of coatings also provides excellent corrosion protection against moisture and salt and is extremely thin, hence its extensive use on aircraft. Hexavalent chromate coatings leave parts with a gold coating. Hexavalent chromium is a known carcinogen and should be avoided - this coating is being phased out worldwide. Trivalent or "clear" alodine is much less toxic the accepted technique. In order to have this coating applied to a part, put the callout: "ALODINE PER MIL-DTL-5541 Type II Class 3" on the engineering drawing. This technique has not been used on any Stanford solar car for structural bonding so should be tested before use. However, this coating is commonly used on aircraft for structural bonding. 

[ much less toxic](http://www.epa.gov/iris/toxreviews/0028tr.pdf)

The same coating is available in stick form for easy application from Henkel: Alodine® 871™Touch-N-Prep® Coating. If the link breaks, the pdf is attached to this page. This product also has not been tested, but might be an excellent way of doing field repairs of structural bonds.
