### Concept 1

[](#h.kciidv1rlxa5)

Goals

* Create a chassis that could be made in a separate mold that used no preformed chassis panelDesign the area where the suspension mounts such that all suspension inserts would be loaded in shear. Eliminate the need for core by designing a structure where the geometry provides stiffness Eliminate the need for a roll bar
* Create a chassis that could be made in a separate mold that used no preformed chassis panel
* Design the area where the suspension mounts such that all suspension inserts would be loaded in shear. 
* Eliminate the need for core by designing a structure where the geometry provides stiffness 
* Eliminate the need for a roll bar

Problems

* The A arms have to be designed asymmetrically such that all the compressive loads go to the outside part of the a armsthe inside section of the a arm mounts will be weak to in plane forces if core is not usedmolding the U requires more laying of carbon around curves which is more complicated because the edges have to be cutMaking a chassis without core is theoretically less good than making a chassis with core

molding the U requires more laying of carbon around curves which is more complicated because the edges have to be cut

Making a chassis without core is theoretically less good than making a chassis with core

Problems encountered

* The design relies on the stiffness of the core in the box beam for strength which to work requires the core to be contiguousThis presents a great challenge in gluing the chassis to the bottom shell which comes out of a different moldOne option is to glue the chassis to the completed bottom shell and mold both after the come out of the moldSince the core is not contiguous for the bottom panel any loads will be transferred into the shearing the bond between the top layer of carbon and core which is not ideal
