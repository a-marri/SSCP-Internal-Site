Actual start date is on a first come first serve basis. If we delay the PO or stuff like that other companies can steal our spot.

If we place a PO and make a down payment then we can lock in a start date

They won't actually start on the project without a final model.

They can give us a price based off of a preliminary model

Just tell them what size outer flange we want

Rock will send us contact details for their suppliers so that we can try to get them sponsored

They use 130 degree C mold sheet

Notes from Rock Snider

I suggest that if your budget is limited, that your team strongly considers having BVC just fabricate the finished plugs/patterns.  They would be ready to go for mold fabrication.  Besides fabricating the composite face sheets against the patterns/plugs, a composite back structure will need to be designed, fabricated and attached to the b-side of the face sheet.  I feel that all of this is well within your teams capabilities.

 

Another option would be that BVC fabricates the finished patterns.

BVC will then fabricate the composite face sheet for the molds, however we send the molds attached to the patterns/plugs, & the Stanford Team…

·         Designs its own back structure.

·         Fabricates the composite panels (or whatever material

·         CNC cut or template cut the panels

·         Attach to the b-side and bond/overlay.

This additional work could save you $7.5 - $8K off the mold sell price.

 

Regardless what direction you go, if you do decided to contract w/ BVC, our CNC mill has an opening in mid October (10.22.12).  The build could actually start 1 -2 wks. prior, so the wood substructure can be designed & fabricated to support the mill.

The revised pricing would be for the written proposal that we sent, w/ the addition of the following notes below…

 

Mold:

* The structural backing will be of an egg crate construction.  Supports will be perforated to allow for greater transfer of air to facilitate your build process.   The actual panels (Qty. TBD)  will be provided & Shipped to BVC.  BVC will CNC cut & attach to the mold back structure.
* The Top Mold bubble will be removed & not required in the tooling.

Wesley, unfortunately BVC is not in a position to donate costs for a sponsorship. I am currently working a lower than normal margin, but on Monday I will see if I can drop a little more.  This would really be a pretty insignificant $ # ( approx. $3K).

 

I am doing my best by offering cost saving suggestions that you could benefit from.

Another would be…

Your team fabricates composite flat panels, send them to BVC, we will CNC cut & apply  for the back structure.

We had planned to buy these out, but I would think that if you had access to a flat structure, you could fabricate (approx. 10 – 13) 4’x8’ panels.

This would have a savings of about $6.5 - $7 K off the mold price.

 

As far as schedule, I could bring in the duration 1-wk.  For a total timeline of 9 weeks. (not incl. holidays).  It is difficult to say what other commitments will be made between now & your team pulling the trigger on this. 

 

We work on a 1st come 1st serve basis.  We are currently running a swing shift, & I think we can work with you on the schedule.
