They mentioned that if we used a CNC instead of hand sculpting they would face twice the cost. 

Hi team,

MFG West finally sent me a price quote and CAD deadline this morning. It turns out that with their sponsorship offer they are significantly cheaper than our other options ($20k less than Christensen and $40k less than BVC) and they are willing to give us more time to finalize CAD.

The catch is they may not deliver our molds until mid January. If they underestimate then it could mean that we wouldn't receive molds until midterm season in the Winter.

 

I wanted to see if you all have input before I make a decision about our mold manufacturer. Christensen is asking for a wire transfer right now, so I need to decide before the end of the day.

PS: MFG West made the molds for Solstice and Equinox.

I just got off the phone with Christensen. They are willing to wait for final CAD, and they are going to go ahead and start manufacturing the platform base for the plugs and molds. I'll try to answer everyone's prior questions below.

-The team was pleased with MFG's work for Equinox and Solstice.

-MFG is in SoCal

-We would have to cover shipping expense ourselves with MFG

-(I haven't called them to pressure the date question yet)

-No quote details from MFG yet-just phone and email correspondence

-MFG wants final CAD in two weeks

We'll know within a day or two if we've missed our mark for drag on the latest body. It sounds like we can get the center of pressure behind the CG if we put the battery pack in the front. Plus we have a couple extra days to sleep on micro features like the array inset, scribe lines, and fairing height.

Wesley:

 

We can rearrange some of our projects to hit your winter break delivery goal.  Assume we will be able to ship the mold(s) to you NLT December 17th.    This assumes you will be able to deliver formal, final drawings NLT next Monday, October 15th.  If this sounds attractive we will generate a formal quotation for you to approve before we move forward.

More details from MFG West:

The have two ways for manufacturing the molds:

1) Depending on their scheduling they may be able to use a 5-axis CNC to mill polystyrene foam. Then they cover the foam with strips of foil and layup the gelcoat and fiberglass on that surface. The foil is removed after the fiberglass cures and then the surface is sanded.

2) If they can't get access to the CNC they would use cross sectional blocks of foam. They said they usually use 6in wide blocks, but were willing to use smaller cross sections were we need better tolerances. The foam would be hand sculpted and then the process would continue like option 1.

MFG West wouldn't commit to a delivery before the 17th since they may want the last weekend to finish the project. Shipping would hopefully only take a day from LA.

Given these details MFG West looks like a less promising option.
