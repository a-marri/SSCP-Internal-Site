## Christensen on their mold manufacturing and leaks

[](#h.katpjzacx38s)

Hi Wesley,   Sorry to hear about the cracking.   But even with a hair line crack in the surface material it's really a long shot for the leak to be occurring from the mold itself.   The mold was built by hand laying 6 layers of 1.5 0z & backed with 1 layer 3610 biaxial stitched cloth all put down with an acrylic urethane system.    This was followed by reinforcing it for stiffness using an modified filled acrylic urethane system sprayed to 12 mm thick.    Then to complete the "I" beam structure we applied a final layer of 3610 biaxial cloth.    There is however one weak leak in the system that you eluded to and that is the variance in CTE's between the vinylester  "High Temp" Gel and the  acrylic urethane resin especially in the high stressed areas.    So you are correct in your conclusion that If the mold is brought to temp or down from temp to quickly it can cause these hair line cracks to appear on  the surface in heavier loaded areas.   But this would not cause the mold to leak.   I know this mystery leaking is maddening "I've been there many times myself...lol" but unless it was a wood & putty hand built mold the issues usually  ends up as tacky a tape seam or even the handling of the bagging material (use care) or even defective bagging material itself....like I said on that rare  occasion we have spent a couple of days looking to fine the leak.   Also Just as an FYI if you ever need to build a few components off of a wood / putty mold all you need to do is coat the back side of the mold with  Rhino bed liner material. "works great"     But again in my opinion it's not possible for the mold to leaking.    Keep me posted, we are here to help in any way possible.

## Process:

[](#h.6zr11teodrqb)

Mold Radii: 

Prefer 3/8 but can do down to 1/8

Which CAD format: 

IGUS AND STep 214

Sribe LInes: After positive finished relocated on CNC MILL and scriped with a small crbide bit to a hairline

Monday Preliminary Release: Mark files as NOT_FOR_CUTTING the outside shape CANNOT CHANGE, but the height of the fairings is super flexable on the order of several inches

Bubble: Send the bubble as a seperate file so cut of the surface of the bottom shell and fill the surface and send a seperate bubble mold. 

Process:

## Christensen's Original Proposal

[](#h.ubn2g1w5cwjx)

   As I read though Bayviews processes to build the plug/master it is very similar to our standard way of building/milling a plug

                Then their quote says that they would build you an epoxy mold.

I’ve been in the industry for 31 years and I don’t believe that this is neither the most cost effective or fastest way to get you your molds.

I have 2 completely different approaches that I would like to run cost and timing on for you.

                                The first would start off as they quoted by building a conventional plug.

  But then instead of constructing an epoxy female mold we would build the mold from an Acrylic  Urethane resin system (HDT 280F – 300F)

                The second approach to the project would be for us to use a system that we developed for the Aero Space and wind industries.                        

                                This system allows us to mill a direct high temp epoxy mold.(HDT 350F+)

                                Sorry but I can’t share these processes with you.

 

I will need to run the project both ways for you so you can decide what makes the most sense for and your team at Stanford.

This will take me a couple of days but feel free to contact me with any questions or concerns that you may have.

 Updates Regarding Billing

For this particular project Bill rated the labor rate at $45/per,  typically the rate is $65/per.  The Mill Daily Rate -this is for running costs only is $1,600 – taking into effect that our mill is 20 feet wide, 60 feet long, 10 feet tall.  This does not include programming, simulations, set-up, etc. 

As a response to your e-mail below I broke down the invoice and it comes to 38% Materials and 62% Labor.  The dollar values are - $29,298 Materials, $47,802.00 Labor and $4,500.00 Shipping.

Christensen offered a $25,000 discount in 2012. They were really nice and helpful. The also delivered before the scheduled delivery date and had great molds.
