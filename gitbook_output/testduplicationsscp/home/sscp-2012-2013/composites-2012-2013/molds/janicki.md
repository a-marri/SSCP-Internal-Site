I suspect that you don't like Bayview's quote because last time around they gave you the tooling.  Your current temperature requirements automatically put you into a high cost tooling system.  Chances are good that you're not going to like my price either.

For your requirements I would recommend our machined vinyl ester system that is good to 275F.  Our normal lead time is 8-12 weeks for this product.  We should be able to hit 8 weeks.  Based on the size and complexity I would put a estimated total mold cost of $154,200

Chances are good that this is over your budget.  If you find a pre-preg that cures at 180F I can put you into a set of molds for around $70,000.  If you want to build your own molds off of our machined patterns I can get the price down to around $40,000.

If I didn't knock you out of your chair I'm happy to put together a formal quote.  If we're too far apart I'll wish you good luck on the new car.

Cheers,

Jimi

After reviewing your request with our executive team we have decided not to participate in your offer.  Janicki currently works with several colleges and universities but those projects are typically much smaller in scope.  We wish you good luck in your endeavors.
