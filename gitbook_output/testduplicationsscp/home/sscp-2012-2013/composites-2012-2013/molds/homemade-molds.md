* Use the paint sprayers to apply gel coat. Make sure you mask off areas that you don't want gel coat on the plugs. You don't want gel coat where you plan to apply vacuum tape. The gel coat should be 0.020" thick. Make sure it doesn't drip.Do not use polyester resin unless you are doing a small quick job. Polyester cures too quickly. Two part epoxies can give you a longer working life.Allow the gel coat to dry long enough so it cannot be scratched with your fingernail but so that it is still tacky.The first layers of fiberglass that you lay down should be as thin as possible. If you use thick fiberglass there will likely be voids and air pockets on your mold surface.Consider vacuum bagging the first thin layers before you move on to thicker layers that way you don't let the first layer cure before you apply vacuum.If you feel the epoxy getting warm you should immediately stop and vacuum bag what you have. The epoxy is exothermic so any areas that are warm will get even hotter and cure quickly.When you are applying epoxy to the fiberglass it is best to have a group of people wetting out the fiberglass while another group arranges the fiberglass pieces.Cover a table in release film and simply pour epoxy onto the dry fiberglass sheets on the table. Use silicone spreaders to spread the epoxy over the fiberglass sheets. You may need to cut thick fiberglass sheets into smaller pieces to get them to conform wellYou will want to post cure your epoxy. West System Epoxy takes 4-8 hours of post curing at 120 F. Check the data sheet for whatever epoxy you use. If you heat the epoxy to hot it may reflow. Assign one person whose only job is to check for bubbles in your layup by ensuring that the layers of fiberglass are firmly pressed against each other.
