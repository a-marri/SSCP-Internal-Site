To see details for the 2015 oven, see oven design.

The team builds a wooden oven every two years to bake our largest carbon composite pieces.&#x20;

The oven SOP is a very good place to start for details on building the oven. The oven is one of the team projects that receives a lot of university oversight, so the SOP document is actually here in the Advisory Board pages.

[here](../../../../../stanford.edu/testduplicationsscp/home/administrative-files/university-admins/university-advisory-board/)

The SOP will give you 95% of the details you need to build the oven.

Here are some additional tips:

1. Make sure you give Sven, and the rest of the advisory board advance warning about six months before you plan to build the oven. Try to get them to approve your updated SOP three months before you start building. Then give everyone (especially Sven) additional updates and reminders as you get closer to building the actual oven.
2. After you have built the oven someone from the Stanford University Fire Marshal's Office (SUFMO) will need to come to inspect the oven. See if you can get Rob Porterfield rporterfield@stanford.edu to do the inspection. He is super chill and even somewhat lax about things.
3. Make sure you do a really good job sealing the top half of the oven. You don't want to lose the hottest air from the oven. Leaving a vent near the ground level to let out cool air is okay. Use silicone sealant, Great Stuff, and cut foam to plug up any gaps.&#x20;

4. Buy foil covered insulating foam from Home Depot to cover the floor of the oven. The concrete is a huge heat sink with a high thermal capacity, so you want to cover it up. Build rails with wood to guide your mold's wheels into the oven and away from the foam.
5. The propane tanks will ice over as you drain them quickly. Use a traffic cone to funnel hot water from the sink in the shop into large tubs. Put the propane tanks in the tubs of hot water and they won't freeze.
6. The large red propane burner has some dry or failing bearings. We lubricated the bearings around the fan in 2012 and the squeaking went away.
7. If you shut off the orange diesel heater it will not turn on again. Let it sit for 5 minutes or so and then try to turn it on again. It should work after 5 minutes.
8. Don't staple the wires for the thermocouples
9. There is a 24/7 gas station that sells propane in Palo Alto. It is the Palo Alto 76. The Shell station on El Camino next to Safeway in Menlo Park also exchanges propane tanks. However, they once refused to give us a replacement tank when they accidentally sold us a half-full tank. Avoid the Menlo Park Shell if you can, or set low expectations. The Shell at the Secret Safeway in Sharron Park also exchanges propane tanks 24-7. There is a 24-7 gas station with diesel at the corner of San Antonio and Middlefield
10. If you have to buy new diesel heaters in the future realize that they have a temperature sensor at the end of the flame thrower. You will need to replace this sensor with a resistor to open the temperature control loop of the heater. Just figure out the resistance over the temperature gauge at a cold temperature and use a fixed resistor with the same resistance. This means you will need to manually adjust the temperature of the oven to prevent overheating your molds or fires.
11. If you can't get your oven hot enough after adding heaters go around the oven and seal any cracks in the oven. that are leaking hot air. Great Stuff, the foaming adhesive, is not rated for our bake temperatures so you will have to use Silicone. If you need to seal a large gap you can use vacuum bag and silicone to patch the hole. Most types of foam will transform and shrink in the oven including the blue foam that falls from the ceiling at vail and the mylar backed insulation foam at Home depot.&#x20;
12. Try to create an wood sealed air gap on the bottom of you oven to cover the cement floor. Cement will be a huge heat sink if you don't insulate the floor.
