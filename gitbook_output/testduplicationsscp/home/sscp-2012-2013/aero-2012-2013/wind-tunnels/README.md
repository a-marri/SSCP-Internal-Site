## Thoughts on Choosing a Wind Tunnel from Danny

[](#h.nk4wheo413y3)

The test chamber of a tunnel needs to be a certain cross-sectional area compared to the frontal area of the car. This blockage ratio needs to be less than 10%, but less than 7.5% should be sought. All wind tunnels use correction factors to account for this blockage ratio (including Aerodyne), but those correction factors become non-linear and very shape dependent when you get past 10%. For a standard car, that means that your wind tunnel needs to be at least ~3x the width and 3x the height of the car. That's a good rule of thumb for the solar car as well.

Wesley is also right about the Reynolds numbers. Reynolds number determines the state of the boundary layer (laminar or tubulent), which is extremely important for solar cars, but less important for blocky sedans and Nascars. Re = density * velocity * length / viscosity. Viscosity is an inherent property of air, so you can't change that. Length is the scale that you are trying to change, so the only two things left to change are density or velocity. Density is obviously difficult to change, so velocity is the only thing left to make up the difference. The air velocities quickly get ridiculous when you get into the 1/4 scale or less. If you get into very small scales then the mach number and compressibility effects start to come into play. It looks like the Specialized tunnel is big enough for 1/2 scale model testing, but cannot achieve the required 100+ mph speed.

Scale model testing could be useful very early in the design stages if all of these factors are kept in mind, but you absolutely must test the full-scale car before going to Australia. That is the only way to capture all of the manufacturing flaws and details and dial in the angle of attack and drag for all the real-time power models used during the race.

Aerodyne also has a sophisticated blower/suction boundary layer management system under the car to simulate a rolling road. The only thing better than this is an actual rolling road, which a few wind tunnels have. Those have issues of mounting and holding the car with a "sting" though. Specialized has used the poor mans approach which is to just mount the bike on a pedestal and ignore the rolling road effects. This would not be good enough for solar car testing. A rolling road or suitable work around would be very important for decently accurate lift and drag numbers.

In summary, the Specialized tunnel is not going to work for our purposes. There may be some other options, but Aerodyne is a really good one if you can't get into the Chrysler, Ford, or GM tunnel in Detroit, which I believe VW is preventing us from doing.

## Other Notes

[](#h.p5ilguswc09w)

Even though it takes a few days to drive to NC and back you may still save on person hours since you avoid the time cost of retrofitting a wind tunnel designed for planes or bicycles to take measurements on a car. The sensors and test chamber of the NASCAR and Big Three wind tunnels are already set up for testing cars. The fixture set up is relatively easy and the sensors are already tuned for the types of measurements you want.

Another reason we leave California to do wind tunnel testing is the way that dynamic loads on the grid are priced/taxed.  

A wind tunnel in SoCal agreed to sponsor us for their time, but we would have had to pay for the energy tax which would have been over 15k for the same amount of time that was ~4k at Aerodyne. 

Ames was $150k per day in the Apogee era
