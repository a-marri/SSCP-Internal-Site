# SSCP - Fairing Design

# Fairing Design

Fairing Profiles

Fairings are one of the prime places to achieve laminar flow. Because of this, we should be using a NACA 60 series airfoil. A NACA 67 would of course give the most laminar flow in perfect conditions, but that laminar flow will transition very easily at an angle of attack. Also, the steep pressure recovery region at the back of the foil makes separation more likely in a crosswind, and may be more prone to adverse pressure interactions between the front and rear fairings. For this reason, we are probably using a 63, 64, or 65 foil, with the thickness TBD.

Design For Crosswinds

Danny suggested that we should design for 5-7 degrees. Apparently Xenith was designed for 10 degrees, and this was too much. After doing some math, this seems to be too little - at 90km/h ground speed, this is a crosswind at about 11km/h (about 6mph). We definitely saw crosswinds higher than that during the 2011 race - just from memory, I would estimate 10 to 15 miles per hour.

Weather Data for Alice Springs, week of October 10, 2011

[Weather Data for Alice Springs, week of October 10, 2011](http://www.wunderground.com/history/airport/YBAS/2011/10/15/WeeklyHistory.html)

The average wind speed listed there for Alice Springs for the week of the race in 2011 is 10mph, with max gusts of 28mph. That's more in line with what I remember - It was really windy, the whole time, and smaller gusts weren't exactly uncommon. 

The worst thing would be to build a car with fairings that seperate if the wind turns out to be bad during the race. Also, if you have a crosswind, your fairings angle of attack gets larger as your windspeed gets lower - and both of these make seperation more likely. Since it may be hard to achieve 90km/h with the new regulations for 2013 (not yet determined), it may make sense to be a bit conservative.

Current Design Constraints

Avoid any separation under these conditions:

* A ground speed of 90km/h (subject to change)A fully perpendicular crosswind at 19.3km/h (12mph)
* A ground speed of 90km/h (subject to change)
* A fully perpendicular crosswind at 19.3km/h (12mph)

* A ground speed of 90km/h (subject to change)
* A fully perpendicular crosswind at 19.3km/h (12mph)

A ground speed of 90km/h (subject to change)

A fully perpendicular crosswind at 19.3km/h (12mph)

* Enough room for the mechanical components (wheel, suspension, motor)minimize wetted area (i.e. minimize length)
* minimize wetted area (i.e. minimize length)

Enough room for the mechanical components (wheel, suspension, motor)

* minimize wetted area (i.e. minimize length)

minimize wetted area (i.e. minimize length)

This works out to be equivalent to a flow speed of 92km/h at a 12.1 degree angle of attack on the fairings. The Reynolds number for boundary layer analysis can be figured out from there, given the length of the fairing needed for a particular profile given the thickness of the wheel and suspension. 

Luminos Front Fairing Coordinates

Luminos front fairing x-y-z airfoil coordinates have been extracted and are attached below. They should be scaled to a chord length of 1.477 meters.
