* We're currently talking to some aero profs about wind tunnel access. It would be really nice to test scale models of Xenith and Nuna. I talked to guys from Umicore, Michigan, and Nuna; they seemed to be in consensus that we'd made some mistakes. The guy from Umicore told us that their simulation results had to be revised significantly after wind tunnel testing.Pending the results of scale-model testing, I'm very tempted to simply use Nuna's design.

* "Our aero body was beautiful, but we need to balance good aero with good mechanical. Front fairings should remain fixed (Michigan got 3rd because of their "windowed" fairings), but they should be enlarged to fit Michelins and allow two-wheel steering. Otherwise, aero was great, and our next car should have a similar shape.""In addition to larger front wheel fairings, we should increase the main foil height a bit to increase the stiffness of the chassis. Not a lot, but maybe from 4 inches to 6 inches at the camber of the foil.""No skirts. I wasn't there, but it seems like skirts didn't work out as well as we wanted. We can look into the Nuna wheel shrouds, they seemed to work well. We should add filets to the bottom of the fairings to make they tougher, and also improve airflow around them." [Later comments from Danny add a new insight which contradicts this]If we use on open source solution Sasha can use Google cloud to do computations quicklySasha has an uncle at GM that is a CADD wizard and could help us. He doesn't necessarily do aero, but he does CADD well
