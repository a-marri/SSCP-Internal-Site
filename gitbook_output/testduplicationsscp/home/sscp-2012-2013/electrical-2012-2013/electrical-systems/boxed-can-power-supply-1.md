# SSCP - Boxed CAN Power Supply 1

# Boxed CAN Power Supply 1

Project Owner: Max Praglin

Overview

Designers frequently want to test hardware without having to hunch over the whole vehicle for hours on end. Or they want to test hardware on the car but the battery pack is unavailable. The boxed CAN power supply's goal is to provide 24v to the CAN power bus from batteries so that the vehicle does not have to be tethered to do some basic testing.Â 

Specifications and Requirements

* Charge batteries from isolated mains supply, also protect batteries
* Indicator LEDs (power, battery status, CAN activity, target power)
* Output 24V @ 2A to target, can be turned off without turning off this box
* Monitor current consumption of target board
* Record and play back CAN messages
* Connect to a computer to send CAN messages

Current Design Implementation

Topology Overview

* When an AC adapter is plugged in, 24v conducts through FETS directly to the CAN Connector. The 24v input also charges the built-in battery pack.
* When there is no power applied on the input, a 36 Watt-hour battery pack (four Tenergy 18650 cells in series) powers a boost converter.
* A USB-to-Serial interface can be used to communicate with the MCU, which will allow interface between computer and CAN. A computer-side program will provide functionality such as message sending and logging.

How Do I Use It?

* Two switches are present on the board, labeled "Boost On/Off" and "Target On/Off""Target On/Off" connects the 24v supply to the target board. Use this for toggling power to the target board while keeping the power supply alive."Boost On/Off" provides power to the boost converter. Treat this as a system "Power Switch" when there is no AC adapter present. If there is an AC adapter present, simply unplug the adapter to turn off the board!

* MCU functionality is TBD based on what the Code Team provides

Components Overview

* A TDK-Lambda 120-24v power supply + C14 power inlet will provide 24v to either charge the batteries and/or power the onboard logic and target boardA pack will be constructed of four Tenergy Li-Ion 18650's in a battery holder - this will provide 16.4vThe LT3759 will be used in a boost configuration to provide 24v from the 16.4v of the batteryThe LTC4007 charging IC will charge the batteries and pass through 24v. It also indicates charge status via LEDs.

* The LTC4007 charging IC will charge the batteries and pass through 24v. It also indicates charge status via LEDs.
* A P-FET will be used to control the source of the 24v: by tying the gate to the voltage input of the charger chip, the boost converter will receive no power unless there is a logic low on the 24v line from the mains supply
* The first revision of the board will have minimal debugging support: LEDs, buttons, and a USB port (to provide serial communication) will be the interfaceThe processor will be a STM32F107_48LQFP unless there is a compelling reason to use a F4.
