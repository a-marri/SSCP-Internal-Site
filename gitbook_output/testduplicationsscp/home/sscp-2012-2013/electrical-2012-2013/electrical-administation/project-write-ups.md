# Project Write Ups

In order to better document the car and share knowledge, every project should be well documented with the following things:

* Purpose/IntroductionSpecifications that the project itself is designed to meetInput/output requirements/rangesHow to use/interface with the project including details software might need to knowimportant layout notesequationsDesign Decisions including why certain topologies, components, protocols, etc. were usedinclude links to data sheets of parts used or websites where you found critical informationinclude a document with equations used to justify your designWhere applicable include appealing alternates and why they were not chosenWhere applicable: revisions that need to made or bugs that were foundif the current design does not include auto caps or changes for final car revision

For clarity, please include headings and make critical information (input/output ratings) easy to locate by making it bold. Long paragraphs are welcomed for detailed explanation but should generally be avoided.
