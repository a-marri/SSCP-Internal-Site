# Funding Guidelines

Traditionally the electrical team has been the least efficient with money of any subteam on the entire solarcar team. Almost every dollar spent on the mechanical system during the 2011 race cycle ended up producing useful hardware for the solarcar project. In contrast, the Electrical Team spent ~5-8k on projects that never resulted in working hardware. Therefore in order to get something funded a project must improve the performance of the car in a real and measurable amount. The following are a list of things a project could do to increase the performance of the car:

* Increase the power production of the carDecrease the power consumption of the carIncrease the safety and reliability of the carCollect data that the strategy team deems to be usefulPerform a critical function necessarily for the car to drivePerform a function that is required by the rules 
* Increase the power production of the car
* Decrease the power consumption of the car
* Increase the safety and reliability of the car
* Collect data that the strategy team deems to be useful
* Perform a critical function necessarily for the car to drive
* Perform a function that is required by the rules 

1. Increase the power production of the car
2. Decrease the power consumption of the car
3. Increase the safety and reliability of the car
4. Collect data that the strategy team deems to be useful
5. Perform a critical function necessarily for the car to drive
6. Perform a function that is required by the rules 

Increase the power production of the car

Decrease the power consumption of the car

Increase the safety and reliability of the car

Collect data that the strategy team deems to be useful

Perform a critical function necessarily for the car to drive

Perform a function that is required by the rules 

Projects that do not do one of the above will not be eligible for solar car cash funding (aka Digkey orders). However, other projects are still able to take advantage of our relationships with companies. Some projects still may be eligible to receive solarcar funding if you can show a working prototype and are asking for money to make copies.

Examples of past projects that would not be eligible for funding:

* Microphones/Audio for Driver ControlsChargersMotor Controllers
* Microphones/Audio for Driver Controls
* Chargers
* Motor Controllers

* Microphones/Audio for Driver Controls
* Chargers
* Motor Controllers

Keep in mind that there is a lot of money flowing around Stanford, waiting to be handed out to students with good research ideas.  If you want to work on a project that doesn't meet the solar car funding criteria you may look outside of the team for funding for parts, while still using the shop's resources and tools.

In order to enforce fairness and make sure members with seniority (aka Greg) don't make exceptions for themselves, all Digikey orders will go through Wesley and Audrey who will be the people with the ultimate authority on what gets funded.
