# SSCP - Luminos Low-Voltage Electrical Draw

# Luminos Low-Voltage Electrical Draw

Luminos averaged ~48W electrical draw during WSC2013 - our goal was no failure, and we achieved that. But there is room for improvement in efficiency!

Attached is a test done in January 2014 after WSC to identify where the power was going - see "Electrical Power Draw.xlsx". In "Tritiumdraw.xlsx" is data on power consumption over a sweep of input voltage.

First, the most unfortunate (but also easiest to fix) source of draw: The Telemetry Server, which took ~10W constantly through the entire race and couldn't be unplugged because we needed it to comply with rear-view regulations (which were actually spot-checked).
