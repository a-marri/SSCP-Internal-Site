# SSCP - Creating a Board Outline

# Creating a Board Outline

The board outline represents the finished outer profile of a PCB. Fabrication houses use a CNC router with a round carbide bit to do the work, so remember that any concave radii will be limited by their tool size.

* Design the board shape in Solidworks. Make a single boss that represents the outside shape of the board.Add a reference point such that your entire geometry will be in the first quadrant. Leave a roughly 1" x 1" gap to the lower-left corner of the board.File > Save As, select DXF.
