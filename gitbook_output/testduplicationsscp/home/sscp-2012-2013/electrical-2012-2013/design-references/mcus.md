[](#h.7f1stk79pr9f)

ST Microelectronics makes some very nice ARM Cortex processors that support single-precision floating point operations in hardware along with a whole raft of useful peripherals. Solar car people are usually interested in the analog to digital converters (ADC), timers for pulse width modulation (PWM), and the controller area network (CAN) protocol generator. We use these microcontrollers on almost every board in the car to do everything from measure the angle of the accelerator pedal to the state of charge of the battery pack. Unlike the Atmel/PIC chips that most 'hobbiests' use these chips have a modern processor architecture which makes them much more powerful. For example, they have a modern 32bit instruction set which makes math with larger numbers much faster. They also have advanced hardware communication and timer peripherals which means they have dedicated hardware which frees the main processor core to do other tasks while data is being shifted in and out of the processor. In addition, they have much higher performance analog hardware on the chips.

## General Information:

Quick facts

* These chips will operate on a 1.8v to 3.6v power supply. Solar car applications will almost universally provide 3.3v.You must provide a 4.7uF or greater bypass capacitor on the Vcore supplies. These are internally generated by a linear regulator to 1.2v.The onboard ADC is quite good, but you must provide it with a very clean power supply. Ask an elder for advice.
