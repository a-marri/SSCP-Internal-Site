The battery pack no longer has a canbus, temp and voltage module sensors are wired directly into the bps motherboard.

The tritium canbus uses a Phoenix 5-pin a-coated M12 circular connectors. It carries CANH, CANL, GND, and +12volts. These are purposely incompatible with the main canbus cables, so that we never accidentally connect one to the other and explode the tritium.

* CANUSB to Phoenix adapters are simple. We currently have two. They can be used with both the Tritium and main canbuses. They only connect CANH, CANL, and GND. Don't connect power!
