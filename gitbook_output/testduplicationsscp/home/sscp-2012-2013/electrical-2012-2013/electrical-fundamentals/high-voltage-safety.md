# High Voltage Safety

Tips/RULES for working with high voltage:

* MAKE SURE EVERYTHING IS OFF AND UNPLUGGED: this is the most common mistake with HV.ONE HAND ONLY: Use only one hand at a time in a battery pack. This prevents current from crossing your heart, which is bad.USE TAPE TO WRAP EXPOSED TERMINALS: Exposed terminals, whether live or not, should be wrapped with tape to prevent them from touching other stuffUSE NON-CONDUCTIVE TOOLS WHENEVER POSSIBLE: Metal tools conduct electricity.

PCB trace spacing versus voltage:

* There's a lot of conflicting information on the web about the "right" spacing to use for high voltage. This is a useful reference: http://www.smpspowersupply.com/ipc2221pcbclearance.html
