# SSCP - Basic Electronics

# Basic Electronics

For those that know very little about electronics, it is important to have some basic knowledge before you can be taught more about a system or design an aspect of the car.

This page is set up to provide a few helpful links to make sure that if your really want to do solar car but feel like you don't know anything, you aren't left behind.

The general basics: http://www.makingthings.com/teleo/products/documentation/teleo_user_guide/electronics.html#electricity

If you understand and know everything that this page says, you are in good shape to learn more!

The diode:http://www.kpsec.freeuk.com/components/diode.htm

[http://www.kpsec.freeuk.com/components/diode.htm](http://www.kpsec.freeuk.com/components/diode.htm)

This is a very useful electrical component. Just understand what it can be used for.

The FET (aka Transistor or MOSFET): http://brunningsoftware.co.uk/FET.htm

[http://brunningsoftware.co.uk/FET.htm](http://brunningsoftware.co.uk/FET.htm)

You obviously don't need to build anything, just understand what a FET is and how you can use it.

Reading the "Basic Information" would be helpful: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-effect_transistor#Basic_information

If you have any other questions http://www.allaboutcircuits.com/ is a rather extensive resource that provides fundamental knowledge about a wide range of topics in an easy to understand way.
