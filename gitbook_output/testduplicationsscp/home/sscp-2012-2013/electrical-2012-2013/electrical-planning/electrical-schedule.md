# SSCP - Electrical Schedule

# Electrical Schedule

Deadlines are listed for the end of each meeting. It is your responsibility to know and meet the deadlines and have a clear communication with the lead on issues, hold ups, and any problems you might have with meeting a deadline. Failure to meet the deadline means that the lead will either finish the project up to that deadline or find someone that can help finish so that no particular project falls behind.
