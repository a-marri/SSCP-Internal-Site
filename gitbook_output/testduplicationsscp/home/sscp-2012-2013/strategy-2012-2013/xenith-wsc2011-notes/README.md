## Xenith: WSC2011 Notes

Words of Wisdom form DC, WSC 2011.

* Strategy worked OK until I significantly underestimated how bad the weather would be. I'll try to renew our WeatherZone sponsorship for next time, so that we have custom WSC forecasts again. We should definitely get a pyranometer and reference cell onto scout. The top teams all have a sat phone in scout along with a BGAN system in chase; we failed hardcore at being able to communicate with scout this time around. WSC2009 was somewhat better, since we had ham radio, but sat phones are by far the most reliable option.
* Strategy also needs more testing and validation. During test drives, strategy should predict expected input and output power beforehand, then validate those predictions over the course of the drive.Discipline. "It sounds like the team wasn't very disciplined. On the drive up, there was a mock race planned, but people weren't on the road until 11am. This is unacceptable. The team should have been keeping a proper schedule, waking up before the sun, doing pre-drive checks of all of the systems, and putting in a full day just like the race. The difference between our team and the top teams is that they are disciplined. We may hate Michigan, but they have to earn the oppurtunity to be a part of the race crew, and everyone knows their specific job on the team, and is responsible for making sure that is done. Also, simple things like tire changes should have been practiced by a tire crew, and they should have been the only ones to change the tires. I still can't believe that someone put the hub motor onto the rear suspension incorrectly. We would have finished in 4th otherwise, but instead we didn't even finish the race."Create an automated system that allows scout to send weather data packets via a ham radio, modem, amateur radio, or satellite phone.
