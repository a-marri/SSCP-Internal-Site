## DC's Data Analysis for WSC 2011

DC's presentation

Day 4. constant speed, with two thirty minute stage stops. 1k power consumption

Day 5 clouds and fail. One stage stop. Weather got worse. Black clouds. control stop near the end. We left and then came back to that control stop.

Power production

1: started with a full pack, so didn't start producing power until the start of the race. Because of hills and forests, and possibly electrical fail, we had more variance. Trees and shadows caused Sam's MPPT's to re sweep causing. Power went close to zero in the late afternoon and in evening charging. A lot of haze in the outback. We aren't sure why less than 200. AR could be hindering us at low sun angles. Evening Charging

2: 7:30 morning charging on the aray stand. Dropped when we started driving. Peak at a KW. Day two we had puffy clouds.&#x20;

3: Good charging. We had the array on the array stand the entire morning. Our pack was nearly full at the start of the end of the fire stop. It is good that we had low pack power at the start of the fire stop.

4: array stand charging in the morning and evening. Power drop to 600W. Some of it is clouds. Some is unknown.

Day 5. The array was shorting in the rain.&#x20;

max instantaneous power was just over 1300W. But we should expect 1100w at solar noon.

140K Coulomb is our pack charge capacity.

&#x20;

Battery pack

-day one. tire bubbles. leaking. trying to catch Nuna and Tokai. headwind.&#x20;

Day 2:&#x20;

-should be like day two. end where we start with charge.&#x20;

Day 3: got lucky at the fire stop

day 4. Trying to outrun the clouds. Started at half pack. better array stand charging on the evening of day three. Hit a control stop. Afternoon drain.

day 5. Bad. The plateau is us at empty pack. We thought our coulomb counter would take us to 140k, but was actually 135k

Average Motor Power vs. Avg speed.

Tires:

Large schwalbes. Reduced pressure as the day went on.

Switched to smaller tires

we started letting air out of the rear shock. Skirts were lower. we started with 1/8 distance between skirts and the ground. In the end we had 1/2 inch to an inch of clearance. They were ragged.&#x20;

VS. Japanese

1: their production was more constant even when they were driving through the trees on the first day.

Tokai doesn't do a great job with aero. Their advantage may be in their power production.s

Perhaps they don't have an algorithm. You could just have a person doing it manually in chase. tweaking position on the IV curves. Or they could just have someone choosing when to re sweep the MPPTS. Could just send a packet to the car with a message to sweep. They had times when they almost produced two KW. Dead constant speed of \~100. They had more variation on the first day due to&#x20;

Day 4. The japanese hit weather on the first day and then they finished or had a full pack.

They produced 12.39 kWh on the third day.&#x20;

Remember: if you are choosing your speed based on rolling resistance and aero resistance then you would just choose one speed to go. However, power train losses are non-linear. So it make sense to make a tradeoff between constant speed and constant power. Consider Michigan pushed their car when drain was over 10amps.&#x20;

Notes:

-Do a full day with a regular panel compared to an AR coated panel.&#x20;

-We didn't record our insulation readings. We should have had an automated wind reading and insulation.

* Can we compare our data to other teams. UNSW.

-japanese had 1k burn at 100kph

-Cloud lensing is neat.&#x20;

-DC is looking at 10cm accurate varios. It can communicate over CAN. We only care about instantaneous speed. Could go in chase.&#x20;

-Mention Ian's GPS to DC

-The faster we go the more outliers. Could be wind buffeting.

-VS. Apogee. we can trust data from the last three days. 800-900 watts at peak in the sun. no clouds.

-Create a PPT with DC's data for VW et. al.

-DC is doing a new race dashboard.

-pyronometer, anonometer, variometer, GPS should be logged and shown.

-Remember that Danny's analysis showed that ride angle doesn't matter much.
