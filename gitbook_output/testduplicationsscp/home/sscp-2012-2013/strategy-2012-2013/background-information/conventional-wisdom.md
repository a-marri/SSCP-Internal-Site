## SSCP - Conventional Wisdom

## Conventional Wisdom

OVERALL GOAL: to minimize total driving time by driving max sustainable speed and ending the race with minimum battery charge.

#### Basic Strategy

&#x20;   1\) Due to the nonlinear relationship between velocity and power consumption (power penalty for increased speed), the general strategy has been to maintain constant, optimal speed.

&#x20;   2\) Alternate strategy is to match the desired state of charge at each point (instead of constant speed).

&#x20; &#x20;

&#x20;   NOTE: These two strategies should be correlated, but differ due to changing environmental conditions such as grade, weather, etc.

#### Power Production

&#x20;   Power Production dependent on climate and weather (pyranometer; cloud cover)

&#x20;   Typical array output \~1-1.3 kW at solar noon

&#x20;   Contrast to below 80W overcast

#### Power Consumption

&#x20;   Power Consumption dependent on drag, tires, wind (anemometer)…

&#x20;   Power consumption 1.1-1.5kW at typical target speed 90kph

#### Solar Vocab

&#x20;       •  Insolation == Solar Irradiation. Wh/m^2 (== J/m^s). Is a measure of incident solar radiation ENERGY over a given amount of time. (set fixed location and angle)

&#x20;       •  Irradiance, Solar Irradiance. W/m^2. Is instantaneous POWER of E\&M radiation. (point at the sun)

Thus insolation/irradiation is the integral of irradiance over time.

&#x20;       •  Pyranometer: measures solar insolation

&#x20;                      \--  Thermopile sensor absorbs radiation, turns to heat, generates voltage, represents insolation.

&#x20;       •  Pyrheliometer tracks the sun.
