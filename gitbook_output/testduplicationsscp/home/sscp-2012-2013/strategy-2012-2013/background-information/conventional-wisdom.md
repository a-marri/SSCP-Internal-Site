# SSCP - Conventional Wisdom

# Conventional Wisdom

OVERALL GOAL: to minimize total driving time by driving max sustainable speed and ending the race with minimum battery charge.

### Basic Strategy

[](#h.k5xt57qnsvsu)

    1) Due to the nonlinear relationship between velocity and power consumption (power penalty for increased speed), the general strategy has been to maintain constant, optimal speed.

    2) Alternate strategy is to match the desired state of charge at each point (instead of constant speed).

   

    NOTE: These two strategies should be correlated, but differ due to changing environmental conditions such as grade, weather, etc.

### Power Production

[](#h.xqzbtoh97ao)

    Power Production dependent on climate and weather (pyranometer; cloud cover)

    Typical array output ~1-1.3 kW at solar noon

    Contrast to below 80W overcast

### Power Consumption

[](#h.66l274fm2n9j)

    Power Consumption dependent on drag, tires, wind (anemometer)…

    Power consumption 1.1-1.5kW at typical target speed 90kph

### Solar Vocab

[](#h.7j0d5hu8fv7u)

        •  Insolation == Solar Irradiation. Wh/m^2 (== J/m^s). Is a measure of incident solar radiation ENERGY over a given amount of time. (set fixed location and angle)

        •  Irradiance, Solar Irradiance. W/m^2. Is instantaneous POWER of E&M radiation. (point at the sun)

Thus insolation/irradiation is the integral of irradiance over time.

        •  Pyranometer: measures solar insolation

                       --  Thermopile sensor absorbs radiation, turns to heat, generates voltage, represents insolation.

        •  Pyrheliometer tracks the sun.
