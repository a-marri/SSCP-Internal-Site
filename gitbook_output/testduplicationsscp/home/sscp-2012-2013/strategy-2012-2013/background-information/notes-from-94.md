# SSCP - Notes from '94

# Notes from '94

Testlist (1994):

        1) Solar array: temp and insolation

        2) Motor

        3) mppts

        4) aero:

                CDa is actual drag.

                Cd*A is model of coeff*area

AERO Cd/Crr:

        Issue w coast down test: too many vars

        Low speed drag effect from motor during coasting

        Wind tunnel tests confirm coast down... Still useful. Knowing CDa(speed) --> rolling resistance

        Company-given Crr ... Then adjust for load of car? Chg of pavement? (even Australian bitumen vs. American highway).

        Different test required for whole car Rolling Resistance (to consider suspension, etc)

BATTERY:

        Battery modeling from supplier;

        Call paper authors

        Temp dependence not as bad.

        Hysteresis and drift bad. Coulomb counters to give data.

        3-battery model. Capacitance. Settle to lookup table values after ~half an hr

MOTOR:

        Multiple gauges to measure AH? (coulombs)

        ** always note what state the car is in when testing (ex; new suspension, tightened, etc)

        110-75 kph slow enough for low-speed motor probs? (probably not)

        But for DOWNHILL grade: power out of motor very low

        Extremely sensitive to % grade.

        > knowing motor efficiency, could calc power at rear wheel as fn of speed by knowing current in.
