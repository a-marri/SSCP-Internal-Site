## Notes from '94

Testlist (1994):

&#x20;       1\) Solar array: temp and insolation

&#x20;       2\) Motor

&#x20;       3\) mppts

&#x20;       4\) aero:

&#x20;               CDa is actual drag.

&#x20;               C&#x64;_&#x41; is model of coef&#x66;_&#x61;rea

AERO Cd/Crr:

&#x20;       Issue w coast down test: too many vars

&#x20;       Low speed drag effect from motor during coasting

&#x20;       Wind tunnel tests confirm coast down... Still useful. Knowing CDa(speed) --> rolling resistance

&#x20;       Company-given Crr ... Then adjust for load of car? Chg of pavement? (even Australian bitumen vs. American highway).

&#x20;       Different test required for whole car Rolling Resistance (to consider suspension, etc)

BATTERY:

&#x20;       Battery modeling from supplier;

&#x20;       Call paper authors

&#x20;       Temp dependence not as bad.

&#x20;       Hysteresis and drift bad. Coulomb counters to give data.

&#x20;       3-battery model. Capacitance. Settle to lookup table values after \~half an hr

MOTOR:

&#x20;       Multiple gauges to measure AH? (coulombs)

&#x20;       \*\* always note what state the car is in when testing (ex; new suspension, tightened, etc)

&#x20;       110-75 kph slow enough for low-speed motor probs? (probably not)

&#x20;       But for DOWNHILL grade: power out of motor very low

&#x20;       Extremely sensitive to % grade.

&#x20;       \> knowing motor efficiency, could calc power at rear wheel as fn of speed by knowing current in.
