## Strategic Considerations

#### Weather Data

&#x20;           •  Short (next few hrs), medium (next day), and long-term (race) forecasting

&#x20;           •  Cloud Race Strategy:

&#x20;                       \-- 1994: Speed up 1kph for every 10% of solar flux lost in clouds

&#x20;                                      -> Tradeoff is aerodynamic drag

&#x20;                       \-- Consider cloud length (ex: 2km), OR

&#x20;                       \-- Consider cloud 'cover time,' given particular velocity (car and/or cloud velocity)

&#x20;                                      -> Supply confidence intervals based on +/- 10 seconds faster/slower (cloud velocity prediction errors)

#### Drive Strategy

&#x20;           •  Hill Strategy

&#x20;                       \-- Accelerate uphill quickly?

&#x20;                       \-- Consider time elapsed, heat buildup, torque, power, velocity

&#x20;           •  Control Stops / In-City Driving

&#x20;                       \-- Optimal stopping locations?

&#x20;           •  Braking

&#x20;                       \-- Regen versus Friction braking

&#x20;                       \-- Base decision on speed, solar output....

&#x20;                                      \- regen braking not worth the time it takes? effectiveness?

&#x20;                                      \- 1994: use only below \~8m/s (18 mph) ... Only infrequently.

#### Cell Efficiency

&#x20;           •  22.5% efficient cells alone >> Graduated indices of refraction in glass >> 0% loss from encapsulation

&#x20;           •  Effect of dicing and recombination?

&#x20;                       \-- Consider NREL data, of Stanford/Suncat versus different UM characteristics

#### Analysis

&#x20;           •  1994 suggests "bracketed analysis" to predict best/worst cases along with target

#### Potential Resources:

&#x20;           •  Topological maps from Geology library

&#x20;           •  Practical Optimization (Gill)
