# Strategic Considerations

### Weather Data

[](#h.1i78m188gkvg)

            •  Short (next few hrs), medium (next day), and long-term (race) forecasting

            •  Cloud Race Strategy:

                        -- 1994: Speed up 1kph for every 10% of solar flux lost in clouds

                                       -> Tradeoff is aerodynamic drag

                        -- Consider cloud length (ex: 2km), OR

                        -- Consider cloud 'cover time,' given particular velocity (car and/or cloud velocity)

                                       -> Supply confidence intervals based on +/- 10 seconds faster/slower (cloud velocity prediction errors)

### Drive Strategy

[](#h.136tqh3gbdsr)

            •  Hill Strategy

                        -- Accelerate uphill quickly?

                        -- Consider time elapsed, heat buildup, torque, power, velocity

            •  Control Stops / In-City Driving

                        -- Optimal stopping locations?

            •  Braking

                        -- Regen versus Friction braking

                        -- Base decision on speed, solar output....

                                       - regen braking not worth the time it takes? effectiveness?

                                       - 1994: use only below ~8m/s (18 mph) ... Only infrequently.

### Cell Efficiency

[](#h.poc4mb7btmy7)

            •  22.5% efficient cells alone >> Graduated indices of refraction in glass >> 0% loss from encapsulation

            •  Effect of dicing and recombination?

                        -- Consider NREL data, of Stanford/Suncat versus different UM characteristics

### Analysis

[](#h.cn3kzdqw3epm)

            •  1994 suggests "bracketed analysis" to predict best/worst cases along with target

### Potential Resources:

[](#h.9hme5ii4zqjo)

            •  Topological maps from Geology library

            •  Practical Optimization (Gill)
