# SSCP - Special Fees

# Special Fees

The SSCP applied for $25,000 in 2010, $50,000 in 2011, and $56,600 in 2012. The team will probably apply for around $98,000 for the 2013 cycle. 

Annually the solar car project is one of the most popular special fees VSOs on the ballot. The team was the seventh most popular group in the 2012 elections, so special fees are a highly viable source of funding for the team.

## Special Fees Notes

[](#h.2tu9iw2olnvt)

* Usually there is some sort of ASSU Special Fees chair or mailing list that you can send questions to.Unless things have changed the SSE is somewhat separated from Special Fees. The SSE does manage the distribution of special fees funds and they police the use of the funds after you get them. However, the ASSU Special Fees committee is the group that coordinates the ballot creation and voting process. You'll want to direct your questions towards the ASSU Special Fees committee instead of the SSE. It is in fact the ASSU people that will ultimately allow you to submit a budget. I think you can also break your budget into sub-groups. I think I read that on the Google Doc you sent me. You could have one line item for composites, one for electronics, one for mechanical systems etc.The ASSU will basically ask you why you need so much money and why you can't get the money from other sources. Fortunately you can just say that you need the money to cover a part of the expenses of a 1.6million dollar car, testing, and racing in Australia. And you can say that you already get the vast majority of the resources to build the car from sponsors. You just need funds to cover the unmet ends of the project.Make sure you track down the SSE's official definition of what you can use each expense type for. I think you can find it somewhere on MyGroups. If you cannot then ask the Special Fees coordinators where to find descriptions.You'll have to find out what the ballot process calendar is. There will be a day when you will sit down with the ~three ASSU Special Fees committee members and they will walk through your budget asking random questions. They could theoretically reject your budget, but that is rare for our team.Expense categories6320 - Technical Services: We haven't used this recently. You probably don't want it. I'm not entirely sure what it is.6510 - Regular Meeting Food: We also haven't used this recently, but you could use it for snacks at our monday and saturday meetings if you wanted6560 - Event Food: You could use this for food in Australia, but you would request this this year. You would have to wait until you are applying for the 2015-2016 financial year (when you are applying for special fees a year from now)7130 - Postage/Courier: We use this to ship our car and equipment to Australia. This covers expenses for ocean and air shipping: i.e. Dedola, Tigers Logistics, and Virgin7410 - Equipment Purchase (Non-Cap): This is basically every tool or equipment that we buy to build the solar car. If it comes in a box to the shop we probably bought it with 7410 fees. We use these funds to pay for aluminum, power tools, electronic parts, array materials, carbon fiber, testing equipment, etc. etc. Since this upcoming school year is a build year I think you should request $98,500 in 7410 and nothing else.7510 - Facilities Rental: This is the category that we use to get $10,000 to pay for the summer house rental. Wait until you are applying for the 2015-2016 special fees fiscal year to apply for this7720 - Gas: We use this to pay for gas in the VW cars and the team van. We use gas for test drives, outreach events, and racing in the Outback7730 - Car / Van Rental: The team doesn't really use this anymore. We used to have to pay thousands of dollars to rent vans and utility trucks for a month while we were in Australia. Now VW loans us vehicles to use while we are in the Outback.7740 - Accomodations: We use this to pay for hostels and camp sites while we are in Australia. The team could also use these funds to pay for two nights of staying in motels on the North Carolina trip. The team usually just camps in truck stops while driving to NC and while on test drives in the central valley. We usually get these funds in the second year of the cycle, but not in the first year.7820 - Registration Expense: You could possibly use this to register for WSC ($6000 in 2013). However, we haven't used this expense type recently1000 - Donations: Donations from ST, LT, Boeing, VW, the University etc.1000 - Fund Raising
