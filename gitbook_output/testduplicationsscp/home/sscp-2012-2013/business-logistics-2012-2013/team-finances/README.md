#### Transferring funds to other departments at Stanford with a PTA

PTA stands for Payable Through Account. It is an account that allows other departments at Stanford to write themselves checks from our funds. The SSE has one PTA account for all of the student groups. You can tell other departments:

The SSE's PTA is 1056598-1-ZBABS. The account type/object is 46615 for receiving funds and 56015 to pay other accounts.  Please reference "group 7848" and "Solar Car Project" if possible.&#x20;

Then I would recommend giving the SSE a heads up that another department will be submitting a PTA to the SSE for the Solar Car Project.
