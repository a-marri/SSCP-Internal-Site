# Media Relations

If you try to get press coverage be careful. Remember that the media doesn't necessarily have a vested interest in presenting the truth. They are mostly concerned with producing stories that are entertaining for their customers. It is easy for the media to use liberal interpretations of whatever you present, so be very clear and precise when describing the car.

The only real value in media coverage is the marketing benefit that it provides sponsors.Â
