# SSCP - Volkswagen

# Volkswagen

Volkswagen is one of the top sponsors of the Stanford Solar Car Project. During the 2010-2012 sponsorship cycle Volkswagen provided the team with two $25,000 donations, a loaned VW Touareg for use in California, and a set of four loaned vehicles (a bluemotion golf, a Amarok, a caddymaxi, and a T-5 transporter) to use during our time in Australia. They also facilitated our Panasonic battery sponsorship and provided general engineering advice for the team. 

In 2010 VW asked the SSCP to sign a contract giving VW exclusivity rights and other benefits. However, this contract didn't actually comply with Stanford policies regarding corporate gifts.

In 2012, the School of Engineering's Corporate Relations office (mainly Todd Logan) realized that the SSCP contract with VW violated university policies and stepped in to change the contract. After months of negotiation, VW agreed to donate to the team without signing a contract. Instead VW referenced our team's sponsorship packet and Todd Logan provided a modified gift letter for Volkswagen. However, VW would now (as of November 2012) like the team to sign a loan agreement on the cars that they loan our team. Stanford has some unresolved concerns regarding this contract.

A taste of Stanford-VW emails: These are by no means all of the emails to VW, but browsing through them might give you a snapshot of our team's relations with VW in 2012. These might be helpful if you need to search for a snippet of an old conversation. Email Wesley or Nathan Hall-Snyder if you need to search for additional conversations.

February 2012 Presentation: A PPT for VW. They like us to give them an update on our progress 2-3 times a year

Gift Letter... This is the closest thing to a contract that Stanford approved for VW's general support for our team

PO Number 45000... Once VW approves funding they will send us a PO. We then need to produce an invoice for VW to pay

Stanford- Automobile Loan... This is the initial draft of the loan agreement from VW for the 2012 Jetta Sportwagon

Stanford SoE Conditions of Gift... This is the standard gift letter for the SoE. Touch base with Todd if you think you need to use this for any reason

Stanford_VWGoA... this is an annotated version of VW's proposed contract with Todd Logan's comments. The team never ended up signing this document

Susan Winsteins comments.... this is Susan Weinstein's comments on the original draft of the Stanford_VWGoA Sponsorship Agreement

VW and Stanford Signed Sponsors Agreement: This was the contract from 2010-2011. The team should not have signed this contract. Do not agree to sign any contracts like this in the future. Have Todd Logan intervene for you

VW vehicle request from the SSCP: this was our letter to VW formally requesting a vehicle. The ERL asked us to write this for documentation purposes. You'll have to ask the board to approve drafts of this letter before you send it

Volkswagen Ask v2. This was our 2012 letter asking for general support from VW. The ERL asked us to write this for documentation purposes. You'll have to ask the board to approve drafts of this letter before you send it

Volkswagen_SSCP Sponsorship Invoice: here is an invoice to update and send to VW whenever they ask for an invoice or the $25,000 payment.

People to know

Todd Logan: SoE Corporate Relations Director. He is pretty chill and is our main liaison/university oversight for sponsorship issues. Keep him in the loop regarding our negotiations with VW and stay on his good side

Susan Weinstein: she works with Todd Logan 

Matthew Montgomery: The SSCP's engineering/business contact during 2010 and 2011. A Stanford alum?

Brian DeWilde: The SSCP's engineering/business contact in early 2012. Now works at Oracle

Kord Luhr: The SSCP's engineering/business contact during late 2012

Peter Oel: The director of the ERL

Prasanth:

Jim Edwards: Contact for cars in Australia. Talk to the ERL people before you reach out to Jim. 

Timothy Adkins: He is a marketing guy for VW who invited the team to present Xenith at the 2012 Sea Otter Classic

aemory@stanford.edu: I don't actually know who this is, but Todd CC's this address to a lot of emails

Allison Airhart: VW's General Counsel representative. She wants contracts to be signed in VW's interest

Tina Dobleman: From Stanford's General Counsel. Todd will probably have her look at contracts before we sign them

Chris Gerdes: His group also negotiates deals with the ERL and VW. He can throw his weight in if necessary since he talks directly with Peter Oel more often than we do

Sven Beiker: He'll always have something to say regarding VW

Nanci Howe: She will always have something to say regarding VW. 

Stephanie Bonovich: Have VW and other sponsors send checks to Stephanie. Sending checks to her office avoids university service fees for donations. Make sure the checks are written to "Stanford Solar Car Project"

Things to Remember

Although the SoE Corporate Relations office may seem like a barrier when they force the team to stick to Stanford's policies they do have an investment in the team's success. Todd Logan ended up spending many hours sending emails and making phone calls throughout the university and to VW's corporate counsel to mediate the dispute. As long as you get Todd Logan or other people in that office to like you they can fight your battles for you. 

Be sure to maintain good relationships with our business and engineering contacts at the ERL. In the end of the day the ERL is the entity that has the most interest in sponsorship our team. Lawyers at the VWGoA headquarters in Virginia may not have the same kind of interest in our team. As long as the ERL engineers and director REALLY like us they can make contractual demands disappear. If there are legal issues in the future Todd Logan is willing to play the bad cop so you can play the good cop with the ERL.

When we got the cars from VW in Australia VW registered our group as a media team. Technically we were on an extended test drive of the cars and then we wrote up a "review" of the cars that we used on our blog. Check with NHS for the details. 

VW is a huge donor for our team. You don't want to screw up our relationship with VW. Feel free to take some time to think before you send any emails to people at VW. Make sure the university is aware of what you are doing with VW so that draining conflicts don't arrise in the future. Feel free to email Wesley if you have any questions or concerns regarding the team's relations with VW and university admins. 

Tips on first interaction of the cycle with VW

Kord is our business contact at Volkswagen. Brian DeWilde was our previous contact, but he no longer works at Volkswagen. I believe he is an engineer, but I am not 100% sure. He works on their E-Mobility & services group so he works on the product interaction in electric vehicles such as the electric Golf and charging stations.

Here are his details

Historically the VW meetings have been a chance for the team to tell VW our previous progress, our upcoming plans, and our need for support. I attached the powerpoint presentation that I used at the ERL two years ago to give you a sense of what I presented to the ERL.

Usually the ERL will ask the team to bring the new car to display outside their office in Belmont. They also sponsor CalSol, so they may try to pick a date on which CalSol and Stanford can present at the same meeting. Then they have the solar car teams present for about 10min each during their all-hands meeting. The offices in Belmont aren't huge so the audience will probably be around 100 people.

The presentation is an opportunity to show the ERL what the team has accomplished, but it is also a time to pitch continued funding for the project. VW doesn't have a long term contract with us (like all other sponsors), so you'll want to remind them why it is valuable for VW to support our team.

Know that I think VW also has a significant interest in partnerships with Stanford as one of the justifications for having the ERL in Belmont instead of having it in Herdon, Virginia or in Germany. Stanford has a reasonably reputable name in the automotive industry, and I've heard that the VW ERL in Belmont likes to show off their connections with Stanford when they are reporting back to Germany. These may just be rumors. Still, it might be nice to remind them about the great potential in collaborating with Stanford engineers and attracting young talent from Stanford.

Their website has pictures of  Junior and Shelley along with the text "The ERL takes great pride in our university collaborations. We work with faculty from the best academic institutions on a variety of topics, such as computer science, engineering, communications, and design. We get to meet great people who share a passion for working on automotive-related research."

Also, be sure to show the VW logos on the car and good pictures of the graphics on the Jetta. I attached a mediocre rendering if you can't find a better one on solarcar.stanford.edu or elsewhere. Make sure everyone wears matching uniforms with the VW logo.

Yes, you will want to contact Kord for all issues related to VW. You would be driving to the VW ERL in Belmont. You'll have to look it up on Google Maps. It is just up the 101 near to Oracle.

I would bring the leadership team and people that went to Australia. However, only one person needs to present. Make sure you practice and get feedback from the team. It may be good to bring a few new members so they can see how the VW meetings go, but you want to make sure everyone can speak knowledgeably about the car. After the power point presentations (in their large conference room) they usually have all of their staff go downstairs to look at the car. The staff engineers will probably have technical questions for you and your teammates, so you want knowledgable people as I mentioned before. I think we usually bring around 10 people. You probably don't need to bring more than the 12 that can fit in the van.

The sponsors mailing list is probably not current. If you use the Stanford Mailman Mailing list mass member add tool (or whatever the name is for the admin tool where you can copy and paste in a list of email addresses) you can paste in all of the sponsors' email addresses. When you click save or submit Stanford Mailman will only add the addresses that are not already on the list.

Usually we only invite sponsors to the unveiling. We invited all of the sponsors to a media/sponsor/VIP preview day before our official unveiling last year. A few sponsors showed up that wanted to film the car for their own media purposes (like ST), but not many sponsors actually attend our unveiling even though it is still a good idea to always invite the sponsors.

Occasionally I'll invite individual sponsors to VAIL if they express an interest in seeing our car, but I haven't invited all of the sponsors for any event except for the unveiling.

Back to VW. I'd recommend running your planned requests from VW past Kord before you formally present them to the entire ERL staff. I know Aarush was talking about doing work with one of Audi's racing teams. Check with Kord to see if a request for a VW sponsored trip to visit the Audi team in the UK and VW in Germany would go over well.

I believe that in late 2011 or early 2012 one of our old VW contacts suggested that VW could send the team to Germany to get advice from Audi and VW engineers. I'll attach the formal ask letter that I wrote in 2012. You may end up needing to write a new formal ask letter for VW this year. You may not need all or any of the items that I put in bold in 2012. These were the bullet point items. You'll have to adjust your ask accordingly. You'll definitely want to ask for $25,000 per year (or maybe a bit more to account for inflation. This number hasn't changed since Xenith. Run the idea of a funding increase past Kord first. It may be very difficult to change the $25,000 IDK.), a Jetta Sportwagen (or something similar that is TDI diesel) to use in the US, and cars to use in Australia during WSC. Be sure to run the letter past Brooke Groves-Anderson, Nanci Howe and Jeff Gordon before you send it to VW.

I also attached a copy of the invoice that you'll need to send VW to ask for money. The final attachment is the formal letter we sent asking for a Jetta Sportwagen to borrow. You'll probably need to submit something like this as well. Send it to Brooke, Nanci, and Jeff like the other documents.

Remember that during the Xenith years VW had a written contract with VW. At the start of the Luminos cycle I spent six months mediating the debate between Stanford's lawyers and VW's lawyers over the new contract. Eventually, VW decided to drop their request to have a formal contract. Be very weary of any request by VW to have a contract for the new cycle. They may ask Stanford to sign a loan agreement for the Jetta, but that should be easy for Brooke and Jeff to review and approve. I'll attach the signed loan agreement. Note that the loan agreement that we used is not VW's standard loan agreement. Stanford's lawyers, Brooke, and Jeff will probably want VW to use the custom contract instead of the template contract this year. Last year Sally O'Neal in the Industrial Contracts office provided the signature.

Give me a heads up if legal issues come up. Remember that if legal issues come up Brooke and Jeff should be able to play the bad cop for you so you can be the good cop and keep a good business relationship with Kord. Brooke and Jeff can even contact Kord, Peter, or VW's lawyers directly on your behalf if the debate is going to turn south. Brooke and Jeff may already know some of the VW people since other groups like Gerdes' lab get sponsorships from VW. Gerdes can talk directly to Peter, the ERL director, if necessary sometimes to fix problems.
