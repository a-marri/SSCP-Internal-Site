# Assorted Advice on Sponsorship Outreach

I can't say there is a clear list of best practices, since every negotiation is different. Different people have very different motivations for sponsoring our team, so it is tricky to figure out the best approach for each sponsor. Some people support our team because they want the tax benefits or marketing benefits. Some people like to support student education and STEM programs. Some people have a connection and support our team because we are part of Stanford or because they want to build their connection with Stanford. Sometimes due to the variety of interests it is good to touch briefly on all of the possible different motivators and see what each potential sponsor responds to.

Here are some other miscellaneous tips.
