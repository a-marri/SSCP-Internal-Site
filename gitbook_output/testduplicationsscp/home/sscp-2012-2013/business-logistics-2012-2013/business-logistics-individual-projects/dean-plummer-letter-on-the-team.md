# Dean Plummer Letter on the Team

Engineering is all about turning basic scientific discoveries into products and systems that benefit people. Projects like the solar car provide a tremendous hands-on experience for our students in the practical aspects of engineering, working in teams and in project management. With very modest resources, but tremendous enthusiasm, the team shows year after year what is possible when a group of bright, energetic students focus on a goal. The School of Engineering is proud of what our students have achieved and will achieve in the future.
