## Panasonic

Panasonic was a particularly painful sponsorship to negotiate for 2013. There were a combination of issues. The team initially engaged Panasonic when they were recovering from making the largest annual losses of any company in the history of Japan. Additionally, our team's primary contact didn't have the same clout as our contact in 2011 (Jim Reily, the director of NA marketing for Panasonic). Negotiations required over a year of in person meetings in Cupertino, phone calls, and emails.&#x20;

Once Panasonic finally agreed to donate cells they asked Stanford to sign a sponsorship agreement. Dealing with written contracts with sponsors is always an especially shitty process, so always try to avoid contracts if at all possible. Stanford's legal advisors are slow and arrogant whenever we are engaging with sponsors. At the same time Panasonic wasn't really interested in dedicating legal resources to negotiating a contract with Stanford.&#x20;

Once Stanford's lawyers and Panasonic's lawyers finally agreed to contract language the next challenge was finding a Stanford faculty member to sign the contract on behalf of the team. The team's advisory board originally asked Chris Gerdes to sign the contract, but Gerdes dragged his heels and avoided the issue for a month. Eventually Brad Osgood signed the contract.

Once Panasonic gave our team batteries they wanted a lot of engagement from our team. They asked for a lot of media and updates in addition to visits and tours.

If Panasonic batteries continue to be the best option for energy dense cells the team should have a much easier time continuing the Panasonic sponsorship in future years. However, do try to avoid changing the contract language that Stanford and Panasonic's lawyers agreed to in 2013, and go straight to Brad Osgood for a signature.

Above anything else, try to avoid asking for donations from companies that are making losses and get around dealing with signed contracts at all costs.

Paul Denning is our main business contact at Panasonic. He is a technical marketing manager.

He helped us get the Panasonic sponsorship through last cycle. The process took months of dispute between Stanford's lawyers and Panasonic's lawyers. Now that I think about it I believe it took over a year from the point that I started negotiating with Panasonic to the point that we had the batteries at the shop. Panasonic provides 18650 Lithium Ion batteries for our battery pack. In recent years Panasonic's 18650 batteries have had the best energy density in the industry, so unless a competitor beats Panasonic you'll want to get their generation C or D cells for the next car.

Settling a contract with Panasonic should be easier this year (2014) since we have a preexisting contract that Panasonic and Stanford agreed to. However, it might be wise to start the process as soon as the regulations come out. First you'll need to let the Board know that you want to renew the sponsorship with Panasonic. Once they approve you can make a formal request for cells from Panasonic.

I mention that you should wait until the regulations come out because the regulations may significantly change the number of cells you need. This year (2013) we asked for 1440 cells, enough for three 21kg battery packs. However, if we were in the Cruiser class we would have needed 3X that amount.

Also, if things go well with Panasonic you can also ask them for things beyond batteries. They were interested in supporting our team with other embedded electronics for the car. Don't promise Panasonic that we will use anything in particular, but you can have our team's EEs talk with Panasonic's engineers, Paul, or sales people to see if Panasonic offers anything that is superior to our other alternatives. Panasonic could even offer consumer electronics for the team. In 2011 they offered us digital video cameras. We ended up asking for laptops instead and that is how we ended up with the Toughbooks.

Paul is really nice, albeit reserved. He is a Stanford grad.

As I mentioned in my other email, he wants to bring some Panasonic people (maybe from Japan) to the shop.

Some more advice from 2015:

I would recommend a few things:

First, you should try to get Stanford and Panasonic to sign the same contract that they signed in 2013. At minimum have the starting point for any contract discussions be the 2013 contract not a brand new contract from Japan if possible. I'll attach the final signed PDF and what I think was the final word document. Cross check the signed PDF against the word document to make sure the word document I sent was actually the same text as the signed PDF.

Secondly, if Stanford and Panasonic resist signing the contract then you should get Stanford's lawyers and Panasonic's lawyers on a conference call with you for a legal review. Attempting to negotiate redlines by email takes a long time, but you can clear up a lot by phone with everyone on the same conference call.

You will need to get the Advisory Board and the Stanford Industrial Contracts Office involved. Go ahead and email the entire Advisory Board, and let them know that you are interested in getting a review, approval, and signature for an Indemnity Agreement with Panasonic. Be sure to stress that the team signed a similar agreement in 2013.

Once you have given the Advisory Board a heads up you can ask Brooke or Jeff if they have someone they would prefer you contact in the Stanford Industrial Contracts office. In 2013 our contact in the Stanford Industrial Contracts Office was Jim Gasiewski. His number is 650-725-0696 and his email address is

jim.gasiewski@stanford.edu.

In 2013 we had to get Professor Gerdes to sign the document. However, Gerdes took a month to sign one of our contracts last year, so we ended up getting Brad Osgood to sign. I would ask Professor Osgood to sign this year instead of Gerdes. Make sure you keep Osgood in the loop and try to find a chance to explain to him in person what the team is trying to gain with Panasonic. Osgood signing the Indemnity agreement puts himself and his career at some level of risk, and he doesn't gain anything directly by signing the agreement. You will have to persuade him a bit to get him to sign on behalf of the team.

Make sure you CC Brad, Brooke, Jeff, and Jim to all of your contract related emails with Panasonic once you get them in the loop on the contract negotiation.&#x20;
