# SSCP - Advisory Board Policies on Soliciting Donations

# Advisory Board Policies on Soliciting Donations

I wanted to send you all a reminder regarding the university's policies on fundraising. Usually student groups are not allowed to solicit sponsorships from off campus sources. However, the team's advisory board has given the team a process by which we can bypass those policies to request sponsorships for cash and parts for the car.

Here is an email outlining the advisory board's official stance

That email (from the Xenith cycle) is slightly out of date so here was the procedure that we actually went by during the 2012-13 cycle.

* If you want to request parts (not cash) from a company you can do so without special approval. For 99% of our sponsorships for parts for the car we didn't need to get university approval. However, you can always request approval if you want to play it safe.It may be wise to explicitly remind the board each year about the precedent for our team not needing special approval to contact companies for parts donations.It would be absolutely terrible if the team had to wait for university approval every time you wanted to ask a company for parts. You simply do not have time in the product lifecycle of a subsystem on the car to wait 2-3 weeks for university approval before contacting sponsors to gets parts for the car. You need to know what parts sponsors you can get while you are designing systems for the car. Waiting for university approval for each component sponsor that you need would actually be the single easiest thing that would prevent the team from finishing a car before WSC 2015 in my mind. Waiting for approval for cash sponsors is survivable, but waiting for approval on parts sponsors would not work.If you want to request cash from a company or an individual you need to get university approval.It is best to bring a list of companies or individuals that you wish to contact to one of the quarterly advisory board meetings. The board will want to know:Company nameWho on the team will contactContact's nameRole of that contact at the companyContact's email and phone number (if available)Type of companyFor example, last cycle we submitted the data in the second tab of this document for the board to approvehttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Aj98Z3dc1q87dFpTdkxodko3T2JqcG5HMjRodDFwbEE&usp=drive_web#gid=3Three people will need to approve your list:Nanci L Howe <nanhowe@stanford.edu>,brooke groves-anderson <brooke.groves-anderson@stanford.edu>,Todd Logan <todd.logan@stanford.edu>You can email the list to Brooke and Todd to get their approvalNanci requires you to submit the list to an SAL database.Read through this for reference: http://studentaffairs.stanford.edu/sal/manage/off-campusRead through this for reference: http://studentaffairs.stanford.edu/sal/manage/off-campus-processFill out this form:https://orgsync.com/42210/forms/44099You'll get an approval from Nanci or SAL in a couple of weeksThe university may reject some of your proposed potential sponsors especially if you contacting the company/individual would interfere with the University's own efforts to find sponsors.The process is somewhat annoying, but you can make the most of it if you reach out to the School of Engineerings's Corporate Relations to get some fundraising help from them. Try to find a time each year to meet with brooke groves-anderson <brooke.groves-anderson@stanford.edu>, Todd Logan <todd.logan@stanford.edu>, or Jeff Gordon <jeff.gordon@stanford.edu>. Let them know what the team is trying to do this year and what kind of support we are looking for. This is how we got the initial contact for Virgin Airlines in 2013. Todd, Brooke, and Jeff will keep the solar car team in mind and if they meet someone from a company who is interested in supporting what you are doing they will put you in contact with the company.Feel free to ask Nanci L Howe <nanhowe@stanford.edu> or Snehal Naik <svnaik@stanford.edu> if you have any questions.Remember that getting approvals can take 2-3 weeks, so be sure to make your requests early.

Feel free to ask Nanci L Howe <nanhowe@stanford.edu> or Snehal Naik <svnaik@stanford.edu> if you have any questions.

Remember that getting approvals can take 2-3 weeks, so be sure to make your requests early.

I would recommend putting together a list of all of our 2012-2013 sponsors and submitting the list to Nanci, Todd, and Brooke so you can get an official approval to contact all of those companies for new sponsorships again. As long as you emphasize that the companies are pre-existing sponsors you should get an easy approval. You could even add sponsors from Xenith or Apogee that we didn't request sponsorships from during the Luminos cycle. That would give you a bit more flexibility to contact old sponsors without getting approval again.

You may want to have one version of the list that includes all of our old sponsors and one list that only includes cash sponsors. If you can persuade the board to not scrutinize your planned parts donation sponsors it would be good to avoid having the university review our non-cash sponsors just to avoid the risk of them making a fuss about one of the companies. Still, they will probably want to see a list of the companies that you will request cash from (e.g. VW, ST, LT, Boeing, etc.)

BTW, Boeing and Lockheed are kind of special. The School of Engineering usually facilitates those sponsorships for us. I would recommend asking Todd Logan if the team should approach Boeing and Lockheed or if Todd will formally request a sponsorship on behalf of our team. Boeing and Lockheed support a log of student groups and research labs on campus, so the SoE often coordinates everything for all of the Stanford entities being supported by Boeing and Lockheed.

Sending thank you letters and pictures to sponsors should be fine without going through the approval process However, be sure to wait until you get formal approvals from Brooke, Todd, and Nanci before you formally request cash from the cash sponsors.

Finally, here is a review of the internal guidelines for requesting sponsorships
