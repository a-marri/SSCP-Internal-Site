# SSCP Fundraising Guidelines

Corporate sponsorships make the SSCP possible and they also help to make Stanford University the great university that it is. It is important that we are professional in our fundraising and the university will be looking over our shoulders to make sure we do so. Therefore, there are some policies that all members need to follow when soliciting donations from sponsors.
