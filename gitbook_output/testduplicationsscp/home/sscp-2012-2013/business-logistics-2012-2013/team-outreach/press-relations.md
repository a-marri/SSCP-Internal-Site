# Press Relations

Press Relations can be a somewhat tricky task to manage. The core issue is that the press doesn't necessarily have a vested interest in telling the truth. The main goal of mainstream media is to entertain their audience.

Attracting press coverage can be fun for the team and good for sponsors, but be sure that the team media representatives are clear and precise when they speak with the press. It is good to have pre-written talking points and for students to not deviate from those talking points.

Once you get one of the big Bay Area media outlets to cover the team (i.e. NBC news, San Jose Mercury) a ton of other news agencies will jump on the story, so there is value in targeting the big news outlets first.
