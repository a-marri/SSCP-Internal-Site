# SSCP - Ferrari Event

# Ferrari Event

The Ferrari Club of North America visit to VAIL was a little bit silly compared to our other outreach events, but it was a fun break from the norm. We probably could have done a better job to get some private cash sponsorships out of the event, but we didn't try hard enough. This page is to give an outline of a example schedule for a longish public outreach event at VAIL
