# SSCP - Aerodyn North Carolina 2012

# Aerodyn North Carolina 2012

The email thread will probably be the most up-to-date source for information on the trip.

Goal: To get Xenith and the aerodynamics team to the Aerodyn wind tunnel in Mooresville North Carolina for wind tunnel testing. Aerodyn is one of the few wind tunnels in the road that have a artificial moving road surface that improves the simulation of ground effects.

Travel Plans: We should coordinate flights as much as possible to prevent multiple trips to the airport. If you are willing to pay for your own taxi rides to or from the airport it you can book whatever flight you want. Otherwise please talk to everyone before you book any tickets to make sure that everyone is flying at the same time. Ideally, we will only need to go to the airport three times: once to pick up seniors at CLT, once to drop off people at CLT, and once to drop off people at HTS.

Seniors should probably fly to CLT on June 19th.

Schedule: This will be tentative until the trip is over and everyone has made it home alive

Booking flights might be a good place to start. Could everyone look into prices for your respective flights? Let everyone know what ticket prices you find. 

Things that didn't work:

-We had concerns that our van might not hold up to driving across the country and back. We looked into shipping options, but all of the quotes that we received were $8,000 to $9,000 to ship the car both ways.

-Craters and Freighters seemed like the best option since they specialize in transporting speciality and prototype equipment.
