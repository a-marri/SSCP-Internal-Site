# SSCP - Stocking Consumables

# Stocking Consumables

It might be wise for the Business team to be responsible for keeping standard consumables stocked at VAIL. This would include things like solder, Kapton tape, gloves, System West epoxy etc.

If a standard consumables inventory list doesn't exist, you could go through the sscp.reimbursements gmail account to see the things that previous teams repeatedly bought from Amazon. You could also ask the prior sub-team leads what they often needed. If you created a Google doc with the quantities of each item that the team should keep in stock you could reasonably easily task a new member with making Amazon orders whenever we are low on things.

Also, the team or someone on the team should buy an Amazon Prime account for saving on shipping costs. In my experience, if Amazon sells a product 90% of the time they sell it for the most competitive price in the market when you include shipping, so I usually just go straight to Amazon when I try to buy something. Their profit margins are super small and they have fast shipping.

Also the team gets discounts with some vendors such as McMaster, DigiKey and Mouser. I might be wrong about the McMaster, discounts. You'd have to look at some old sscp.reimbursements receipts to see if there is a discount to the subtotal or shipping applied. Digi-key requires a passcode that the Team Lead should have. You may need to renew the Digi-key sponsorship if they stop giving us a discount for some reason. Mouser orders should automatically give you free shipping if you mail it to VAIL.

Whoever controls the team credit card and makes orders for the team should realize that some websites (like Amazon and McMaster) offer tools for people to send you a wish list or purchase requisition. McMaster has a link to "forward" an order once you build the order. If you get people on the team to build a purchase requisition for you all you have to do is review the order and click buy to put it on the team card once they send it to you.

I usually buy MEK and Acetone from McMaster. Go ahead and buy it in 5-gallon drums when you need it. You might be able to find better rates if you shop, but McMaster is convenient.Â 

Make sure you buy 99% isopropyl. Some store bought alcohol is 30% water. Safeway sells 99% isopropyl in pint sized bottles. McMaster says they can't sell isopropyl in CA, but they won't tell you that until you place an order.
