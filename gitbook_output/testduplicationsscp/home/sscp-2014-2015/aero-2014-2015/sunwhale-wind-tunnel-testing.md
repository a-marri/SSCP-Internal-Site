# SSCP - Sunwhale Wind Tunnel Testing

# Sunwhale Wind Tunnel Testing

We'll come back and elaborate on this in much greater detail when our wind tunnel test date gets closer, but I'm starting this page now to document some of the testing we've started talking about.

Boundary Layer Transition

In addition to the standard yaw/pitch/ride height/etc. sweeps that we'll plan on running, it would be great to do a boundary transition measurement. This would require some additional planning to get the equipment for it, but it would be really interesting to know to what extent we see laminar flow, if any. Unlike a ride height and pitch sweep, this won't help us optimize our race configuration. However, it will be a valuable data point for the team as we move forward with aerodynamics. 

Prof. Lentink (Anna's fall quarter ME70 professor) has actually conducted the same study on Nuna1 in a DNW wind tunnel back when he was at Delft. We could easily build our own stethoscope using a $35 microphone, thin steel tubes, and a guitar amplifier.
