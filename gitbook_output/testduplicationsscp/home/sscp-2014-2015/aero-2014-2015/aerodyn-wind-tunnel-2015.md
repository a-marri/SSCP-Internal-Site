For flow visualization, I would start with smoke since it is already set up. I agree on the surface flow vis. However, I can pass along sample mixtures later if you wanted to do some testing outside of the tunnel afterwards (i.e., by driving the car). 

 

For tufts, you want to go as small as you reasonably can. The book, Low-Speed Wind Tunnel Testing (any edition, look for flow visualization in the index), has a few pages on it. The smallest diameter sewing thread or thin fishing line you can find are options. To go to smaller diameters (so-called mini-tufts) than that requires special orders (and minimum orders). While the mini-tufts have the least impact, they are so small that you have to dye them with UV and use black lights to see them. 

 

Given your time, I would select the smallest diameter sewing thread or fishing line in a color that you can see against your backdrop. Again, due to time constraints, I would use tape rather than glue. Find the thinnest tape you are comfortable applying and taking off the model (Scotch tape would work but can be difficult to take off cleanly). On a hard surface, stretch out several lengths of the thread in parallel lines. Lay strips of tape across them, and then snip the thread at the start of the next piece of tape. This method allows you to build up tuft strips very quickly and uniformly, as well as quickly transfer them. There is no reason not to try this out on another car before you go. While each strip of tape will present a little disturbance to the flow, I would expect it to be thin enough not to play a significant role in whether the flow separates or not. 

 

In terms of vortex generators, I know NASA has a couple papers on optimized designs that are freely available. Basic searches for NASA vortex generators (or simply vortex generators) will turn up literature. One student at ND was doing some research with vortex generators that I could try to track down if you wanted/needed. 

 

If you make them yourselves, very thin sheet metal that you can cut and bend should be sufficient (rapid-prototyping is also an option given their small size). I would pay attention to what impact the vortex generators have for yawed incoming flow.
