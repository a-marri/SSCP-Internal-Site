3/15/14 - Meeting

Greg, Darren, Max - getting our own Fluent toolchain set up

* CAS file includes geometry, mesh, simulation parameters
* ANSYS mesher - less manual, but the error messages are not as helpful as in ICEM
* Greg suspects that the drag is more affected by un-smooth pressure gradient than we usually think (books would say friction is important)Affects us more than other applications because of 3d effects, etc?Someone should look up if compressing/decompressing flow could cause the losses that we see in pressure drag from fluent. His conversations with Adem suggest that not managing pressure gradients around fairings well, for example, could be really importantLook at cross-sectional area under the car - can prevent accelerating/decelerating flow by keeping this area constantMichigan tries to match a pressure distribution from an airfoil that is known to have low dragGet pressure distribution from Fluent in a length-wise slice. Look at difference between this distribution and what the ideal distribution for a low drag should be. Plug in this difference somehow to Javafoil to generate the shape that we need to add to the airfoil that was simulated. For some reason (Greg doesn't remember exactly why) moving fairings forward and bubble forward reduced dragAn asymmetric car with one full fairing and two fairings on the opposite side could channel air in a crosswind and cause pressure to be high under the rear of the car, making the rear cut loose possibly?Worth considering the design cost of moving to an asymmetric car (which we think would be higher performance if implemented well). Should look at this versus rolling back to a thin Luminos and iterating on that.

Francisco, Tom, David - Conceptual Design

The plan is:

* Generate a series of meshes for different configurations (with bubble, without bubble, located in different positions, etc)… These are going to be the starting points configurations for the automatic shape design. - DavidImplement the constraints for the driver and solar panels in 2D. - TomImplement FFD boxes in 2D to increment our flexibility designing 2D stuff - Francisco

4/02/14 - Meeting

Present: Francisco, Tom, David, Max, Darren, Guillermo

Topic: Check-In and Final Tool Setup

1. Publish papers, get more mechanical team members involved in aerodynamic design for making new geometries. Set up two workstations.

a.     Aero team uses Pointwise to make meshes—we use Fluent.

b.     SU2 training for new members.

c.     Find conference or journal in which to publish. A lot of conferences happen during the summer, says David. Papers due October or November.

d.     Talk with team core about academic research publishing.

     2. Plan is to try various different good geometries and then iterate on these using 2D cases before 3D cases. Analyzing various geometries reduces the chance that we are tricked into finding a local minimum as opposed to a global minimum where the lowest drag numbers possible are found.

Workflow

Cad to Mesh to CFD to Results to Analysis back to CAD

6/11/14 - Meeting

Present: Francisco, Tom, Max

CAD models for comparing concepts: SSCP needs to build up a set of CAD models that are roughly the same size. Will help compare apples-to-apples. Due: 6/20/14.

Finalized the plan going forward for the aero design. Gantt chart is attached.

![](../../../../assets/image_ae68e91a45.png)

6/25/14 - Meeting

Present: David, Tom, Max, Guillermo, Anna, Darren

Will move forward on simulating catamaran but SSCP is open to other designs. Discussed workflow and tool chain to be used. Established weekly meeting time and place as Wednesdays, 7:30PM at VAIL (snacks will be provided). 

SSCP does CAD, passes on files to David for meshing, passes on mesh to Tom for computation, passes on results to all of aero team for interpretation and wisdom. SSCP import deformed mesh to new CAD, unless the mesh changes are more fine-scale. For when mesh changes are minute, CAD will be updated every 5 iterations. Darren will make sure components fit in the overall car system. 

Defined units and axis. Axis origin to be center, front-most point of car. Use standard aerospace right-hand basis. 

Constraints better defined. 6" minimum thickness for car, maximize car width before changing length (max length 4.5m).

To do: Choose airfoil before Friday 6/27/14, send CAD to David for meshing over the weekend, and discuss mesh or CFD results next Wednesday. Remove fillets from existing CAD models.

Summary of Last Meeting's To-Do

* Anna drew a bubble according to the Leading Edge notes
* Guillermo learned how to set up a run on SU2
* Max completed a new iteration, Sunwhale-18.

Anna drew a bubble according to the Leading Edge notes

Guillermo learned how to set up a run on SU2

Max completed a new iteration, Sunwhale-18.

Notes

* Sunwhale018 has had trouble meshing. Re-exporting IGS and Rachel will try again
* Max's crosswind simulations have shown decambering the fairings does not improve crosswind performance.
* Decambering the fairings has introduced much downforce and thus caused big induced drag. We will re-camber the fairings to address this downforce and bring the induced drag down again. 
* Carsten's thoughtsThe cambered fairings looked good; -016 has too little space between the fairings, creating channel flowWe may want to angle the fairings slightly to get stagnation point more near the leading edge of the fairingsRear of the bubble should be a much more gradual joining with the main foil, if possible (done already in new design by Anna)Consider blunt ends on the fairings and bubble - this could trade some front-on drag performance for better sidewind performance (reduced area)Fairing blend looks better. We could have a more diagonal shape if we wouldn't intersect with the wheelCan the bubble be smaller? (in flow direction à sidewind performance)Noted some strange coloring behind the blend of the fairing and the rear of the car - look for wingtip vortices. Mesh is not great here

10/15/14 - Meeting (Wed, 6 PM)

Present: Max, Darren, Anna, Guillermo, Tom, Susan

Notes

* Anna discussed Sunwhale-27 with feedback from Tom. Email feedback from Carsten and Nathan Golshan was also discussed. Anna mentioned her conversation with Dutch ME70 professor. Can we invite him to the next aerodynamics meeting, without fear that his national pride will outweigh his Stanford pride?Nathan Golshan has offered to refine a surfaced model of ours. Discussed location and orientation of fairing seams. Aim for parallel seams and try to avoid vertical seams on front third (approx) of car. Comments on the bubble: Centerline of bubble is not in line with centerline of driver. Is this a good thing? Minimum length-to-width ratio is 6, but more is better. Bubble is one surface--we want multiple surfaces knit together for more control. Tom's update on adjoint method: Can't yet get a sensitivity map without using adjoint, which is misbehaving.

Action Items

* Anna: On Sunwhale-28, Anna will round out bottom-front corner of fairing, and add 45-degree sweep to front of fairings. Make sharper trailing edges on fairings and bubble. Take Nathan Golshan up on his offer to surface-refine Sunwhale-28 after we run its simulation. Fix airfoil front divet integration that showed up on Pointwise. Looks like problem is not in mesh. Focus adjoint method on trailing edge corners after bringing car to zero lift via underbody deformation. Focus on maintaining constant cross-sectional area within fairing tunnel, given that Aravind's new suspension model will allow us to move front fillet inward. Anna: Get rid of bubble "shelf" on left side of car so that bubble integrates well with left fairing. Max: Talk to Ian to coordinate CATIA curved fitting of array. Guillermo: Figure out who's free (Matt, Peng, etc?) when Ian is. We really want the bubble to extend farther back, with or without the rear bubble cutoff. Can the solar array area allow this?Anna: Look into rounded leading edges (Nuna style). Aravind: Simulate 4" vertically-spaced suspension and compare to simulations of 5" suspension. Anna: Try to fit transponder in the rear of the roll cage so that its conical transmission frustum goes through bubble.

Present: Max, Darren, Anna, Guillermo, Tom, David, Carsten Othmer, Rachel

Notes

* Carsten and David did a moment analysis on the angle-of-attack simulations done by rotating meshes. They used a mass of 200kg, which is conservative. We expect ~280 kg (80kg person plus 200 kg car).
* Cp profile of leading edge of car is not smooth and shows some jagged wiggles. Possible issues: CAD divets, mesh resolution, CAD shape overall 
* Siemens NX cannot rebuild SolidWorks feature tree; we would be using NX for surface cleanup only, and to know the tool works. 
* Driver breathing duct should be placed at the base of the canopy, at stagnation point

Notes

* Sunwhale-32 has 40N of drag or so, and a lot of lift. Induced drag? Camber of 5.5 on main airfoil is too much, overcompensates for 3.5 camber on previous iteration of Sunwhale-31
* Leading edge (nose of cars) moves noticeably in z-axis with camber. 
* Ride height was 6 cm.

11/19/14 - Meeting (Wed, 6 PM)

Present: Max, Guillermo, Anna, Rachel, Tom, David, Harry

Notes:

    - David/Tom successfully deformed underbody of Sunwhale-31, reducing downforce and overall drag

    - Discussion of how to go about applying this deformation to Sunwhale-33, and how to replicate these changes in CAD

                Box for underbody deformation constrained by location of chassis panels (i.e., 12" either direction of centerline)

                Steering rack does not appear to be a space constraint concern

                Deformation along whole channel of fairing

                Representing deformations for replication:

                        cuts lengthwise of car (like a new airfoil profile) to substitute for the bottom airfoil spline

                        cross section cuts of car (like front on view) at defined locations 

                        or STL import and overlay in SolidWorks

    - Other areas that we could deform on car?

                Topside of car? Comparing relative sensitivities of top and bottom, since we know there are nontrivial gains from deforming bottom?

                         Max: deformation box on top of car could be entire width of car, starting around 1.6m back from leading edge, and extending                                      1.2m long. * will be slightly different because suspension location is slightly more forward in 33

                Front of fairings? --> Nah, harder to do with complex geometries / we understand generally what needs to be done here. 

                Trailing edge? We have pretty good pressure recovery right now

    - Crosswind sweeps result from Sunwhale-031 look reasonable; not too concerned about these.

    - Max, Anna, Tom? etc. are around for Thanksgiving week; Rachel is available to mesh. WE REALLY OUT HERE TRYNA AERO.

    - Running on Sabalcore: we're hard limited to 300 cores. Set to whatever's below that; also chrome has been faster for us.

    - Also let's write a paper.

Action Items:

    - Darren: Add chassis to Sunwhale-033 and verify constraints for underbody deformation (e.g. box on underside of car where we're safe to                 push up surface)

    - Tom/David: See if we can get automatic to run for Sunwhale-033 and/or manual deformation

               send Anna section cuts of deformed car (xyz points, in columns works fine)

               run adjusted angle of attack versions from Rachel

    - "Anna, I think your bubbles on previous cars have looked better." - Max. Anna agrees.

              also play with the junction of fairing to front of car, to address weird low pressure zone

                  (read: more cowbell at the front fairing junction with the car)

              talk to Prof. Lentink about mic equipment for detecting boundary layer transition for wind tunnel testing (!!!) [or Eaton.]

              send David locations of mainfoil definition planes 

    - Rachel: Adjust mesh 0.5 & 1 degrees pitch up (to re-run addressing the stagnation point still being slightly topside on mainfoil) (about                       centroid?)

11/26/14 - Meeting (Wed, 7:30 PM)

Present: Max, Tom, Anna & a delicious Apple Spice Streusel Pie

Notes:

       - From Max's update email:

            Sunwhale-034 has 0.3N less drag, and the only difference in geometry is the bubble. We see 11N less downforce too, and have             verified that the car is being run at the correct ride height. The geometry seems nicer in -034 (see photos below - there is no line at                the leading edge of the fairing). The -034 mesh is about 2M cells larger. The CAD is much smoother and we don't know why...

       - Discussed other big-picture car items: suspension in rear (possible to do modeling of the geometry and resulting loads on chassis panels, because right now that's an unknown); array mounting (if anything, junctions on surface should be divots and not protrusions. probably no way to not trip flow if it's laminar prior to that, but we'll do our best with that seam); etc.

Action Items:

- Tom: Set up adjoint for Sunwhale-034 for underbody deformation; recalculate sensitivities for Sunwhale-034 to see how things have changed around the fairings. 

- Anna: Make appropriate edits to fairings as previously discussed, once new sensitivities have been run for -034. Probably still more cowbell (junction @ front of fairing to mainfoil). Also tweaks to the bubble surface (new slight fluctuations in pressure where guide curves were added. awk.). And fairing bottom edge fillet. Replicate adjoint deformations in next available model.

- Max: Continue coercing us young whippersnappers into line

- Darren: Continue to make sure that we can has chassis

- Guillermo: We're at 90k core hours :) 

5/23/15 - Meeting (Wed, 7:30 PM)

Present: Max, Tom, Anna & a delicious Apple Spice Streusel Pie

In a couple weeks, we’ll want to meet again to compose a more detailed tentative schedule that lists our priorities for testing and minimizes user interaction so we can get the most done possible!

Here’s a list of action items (let me know if I missed anything!), and below that are notes on our meeting:

* ·        Anna: mounts for the car when it has no wheels, microphone, ask Lentik about tassels
* ·        Gui: ask questions for Aerodyn (see below), research performance coating
* ·        Rachel: 50M mesh, AoA meshes
* ·        Max: CFD for meshes^ (also see below for more detail)
* ·        Aravind+Darren: What AoA can we have? What ride heights can we have?

·        Anna: mounts for the car when it has no wheels, microphone, ask Lentik about tassels

·        Gui: ask questions for Aerodyn (see below), research performance coating

·        Rachel: 50M mesh, AoA meshes

·        Max: CFD for meshes^ (also see below for more detail)

·        Aravind+Darren: What AoA can we have? What ride heights can we have?

Notes:

·        What do we want to measure?

o   Angle of Attack sweep: what angles can we have?

o   Ride height: what range can we have?

§  Nominal target: 6 cm ride height à Find an acceptable operating region and translate that to the best ride height

§  Can change suspension preload to change ride height

o   Yaw

o   Speed Sweep: 50 kph (minimum race speed, ~30 mph) to 115 kph (~70 mph)

·        Brainstorming for a Tentative Schedule

o   Wheel Wells

§  Block with tape over to match the CFD

§  Mounts for ArcTan, see design files for Luminos pegs

o   Visualizing the flow

§  Tassels (see: Icon Aircraft stall)

·        Lentik would know more about these – how do we arrange them?

·        Focus behind the bubble, fairings, under the car in the divot, outsides of fairings rather than the front of the car

§  Tufts

§  Smoke Wand

§  Microphone

o   Separation: around the bubble, fairings?

§  Make sure seams are completely covered

§  Bring vortex generators (tiny airfoils/fins)

§  Possible performance coating (for laminar)

§  Strips of sand paper to trip the flow

·        We modeled everything as a turbulent layer – we can trip the flow right at the beginning to compare better to CFD

·        If tripping the flow results in lower drag, that’s ok! –Dr. Economon, c. 2015

·        Questions for Aerodyn

o   Dimensions of the tunnel

o   What does Aerodyn do to test for separation and visualize the flow?

o   Will we be able to get a camera view under the car (to see action near the divot)?

·        Mesh+CFD

o   50M cells: increase resolution of mesh and run to complete convergence

o   Angle of attack meshes – need possible angles

o   Bounding box = wind tunnel dimensions

o   Inviscid/Euler walls on the sides

o   Plot of the floor pressure in the CFD

Next meeting:

We basically have 4 weeks till the end of the quarter.

- I can do tassel testing next Saturday (although probably not this one). 

- I don't think our additional CFD runs will change our testing plans (so doesn't matter when we meet in relation to when those finish), but we should have those done soon.

5/20/15 - Meeting (Wed, 7:30 PM)

Present: Max, Tom, David, Darren, Gui, Susan, Max D, Anna O, Sara Rood, Jamie, Hanand flava-blasted goldfish

Aero Action Items

Visuzlization 

- Tassels first, smoke wand after

-Side wind with tassles on?

To-Do

-Find the best tassel material to use. 

-Check chemical makeup of smoke wand. 

Simulating

- Front-on 7cm ride height

- Front-on +0.6 degree angle of attack

- Front-on -0.6 degree angle of attack

Our Box Parameters so Far

- We have been modeling the wind tunnel as a box with inviscid walls. 

- Let's model the wind tunnel with the closest dimensions possible.
