# 2014-2015 Insets and Final Mold Features

Door gap

30mm longitudinal gap (between modules) along door seam

20mm latitudinal gap for front and rear of door

Array Inset

Array samples (existing samples measured by Darren 12/06/14) have a thickness of at most 1.8mm

VHB comes in thicknesses of 0.15, 0.20, 0.25, 0.30, 0.35 millimeters.

Luminos array inset is 2.0mm.

We will use a 2.5mm inset for sunwhale because the front of luminos array is slightly above the aerobody shell.

Array Wiring Channels

Luminos inset is 1.5mm

We have decided to adopt a wiring strategy closer to Luminos- drop wires from modules down through the topshell as soon as possible.

For panels that would drop into an inaccessible region, they will be run longitudinally along the surface until they can be dropped into an accessible region. 

The channel needs to accommodate at max one wire so can be Luminos depth.

One flat wire (new proposed wired) is 59thou = 1.5mm

Old flat wire (used on luminos) is .127mm

We will use a 1.5mm- 2mm array channel for sunwhale 

WSC frontal sticker needs to be visible from top-down and front views; it is 150mm tall. We have budgeted between 140-150mm for the frontal sticker, which should be OK because curvature gives us extra length.

Scrapped Plan

We were going to run all wires along 4 channels on the surface of the car and drop them in together at a central location in the car. However, this requires a maximum channel thickness of 6 wires, which would have been 0.45 inches thick in a VHB+ wire stackup. 0.45 inches of channel depth makes core behind the array and tolerances a problem, and this wiring scheme has higher power lost in thin wires.
