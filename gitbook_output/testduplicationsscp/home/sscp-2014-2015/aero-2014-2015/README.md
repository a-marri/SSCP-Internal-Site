## Aero 2014-2015

Aero is huge. Aero is also the area in which the team lacks the most knowledge and resources, especially given that our competitors are the likes of teams of aero grad students from leading universities in the field.

This cycle we've teamed up with David Manosalvas and Thomas Economon, two grad students / PhDs in Aero/Astro, who are working on SU^2.&#x20;

Our biggest challenge is currently meshing, where our team completely lacks experience and just about any useful know-how.

We've worked out a toolchain that we hope to be able to use for aero iterations and analysis. However, during our 7/12/14 Preliminary Design Review, we heard from Adem that this was far too slow and high-resolution for the type of aero we need to be doing at this point in the cycle. We need to look into a rapid, low-res meshing/CFD process that we can use to churn out many iterations. This is important for comparing high-level design differences, before we focus in on dialing in any options.

We also need to validate our new toolchain results against known data from Luminos, another point that was re-emphasized during our 7/12/14 Design Review. If we're switching to new software we need to verify that we can compare its results to past numbers. \*As of August 13, SU2 has been verified to produce the exact same drag and downforce results as those produced by Fluent.&#x20;
