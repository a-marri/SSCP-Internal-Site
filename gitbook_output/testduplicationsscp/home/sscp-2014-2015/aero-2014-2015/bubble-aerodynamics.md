â€‹Hi Guillermo

Thanks for your question

The intent of Regulation 2.4.4 is to minimise the impact an occupant's head might have on any part of the Solar EV in the event of a crash.

The design criteria we use is based on the international (UNECE) figures which determine the minimum space required for each occupant's upper body to move in an arc around their hips.  The requirement is that the radius arm must be able to move 7 degrees left and right of the central vertical plane at every forward and rearward angle.

We find it interesting to note that (from some of the modelling that has been done) the ability of a motorcycle helmet wearing 95th percentile person meeting the eye-height would likely be constrained in this minimum space such that it may not be possible to move the upper body sufficiently to meet the field of vision requirement detailed in regulation 2.6 .

As always, many things require trade-offs.

Good luck with your project.
