# SSCP - Solidworks FlowSim Quick Simulations

# Solidworks FlowSim Quick Simulations

These are some quick CFD comparisons of different solar car models. 

I used SolidWorks' CFD solver with standardized conditions. Here are the conditions: 

Parameters for SolidWorks FlowSim

From Center of Car, farfield forward is 9750mm, and farside rear is 7575mm. Bounding box is 10mm thick. 

Road surface mesh is a wall with moving speed of 24.6 m/s. 

Place road surface 40mm below fairing bottom edge. 

Use level 5 for meshing.

The Solidworks part files and CFD results are in the FTP server under cars/aero/FlowSim CFD of Models.
