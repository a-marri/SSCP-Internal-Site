Symmetrical Car Models

Key:

Long 4.5m, Med 4m, Short 3.5m

Wide is 1.75m, Narrow is 1.5m

Front refers to a front-biased bubble at 1/3 length from the front, rear refers to a rear-biased bubble at 1/2 length from the front.&#x20;

These cars use the NACA-64A-006 airfoil, as used by the assymetrical catamarans also modeled.

&#x20;

Read Me on Creating Symetrical Car Models:

We used a standard "generic" bubble modeled after the bubble used on the catamaran concept cars and mated these to symmetrical car bodies.&#x20;
