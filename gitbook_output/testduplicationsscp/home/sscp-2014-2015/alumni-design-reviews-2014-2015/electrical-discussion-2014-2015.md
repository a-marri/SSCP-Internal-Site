## Electrical Discussion 2014-2015

As a new team (new cycle), we have to discuss how ambitious we want our electrical system to be and how much effort we are willing to put in to recruiting and teaching new EE members. Some alumni noted that it seems like our electrical plans are not ambitious enough; the team believes it is difficult to embark on more ambitious EE redesigns without the commitment of enough EE new members. Several ideas were exchanged as to how to create an atmosphere that will attract new EE members and make them feel like a valued part of the team.&#x20;

From Greg Hall:

I was impressed with some of the analysis at the design review and was happy to see preliminary aero results which is \~3 weeks earlier than previous teams. In addition, I think the higher level technical design decisions are being approached with a greater level of analytical rigor.&#x20;

However I have a couple of broader criticisms. Firstly, I think you are being too conservative about  your goals for an electrical redesign. Here's why:&#x20;

* We need to nurture new talentEEs have made up a significant fraction of the teams sr leadership since 07The fact we have EEs who know how to put together that never explodes is a huge competitive advantage Electronics cause teams to spend time on the side of the road just as often as mechanical failuresMany of our top competitors including Michigan, Tokai, and Twente have had serious EE issues during the last two racesThe 2017+ teams will probably blow up cars without EEs Electronics development  for solarcars is comparatively inexpensiveElectronics is comparatively low risk Most of us would never have stuck around the team if there were not EE things to do so our labor was 'free''A lot of our outside cash is from electronics companies who might not sponsor us if we did not have such an electrical focus.&#x20;

Here are some off the top of the head ideas for things which are challenging and could excite a good new EE:&#x20;

Make sure to frame things for new members to give them a good sense of the challenge. I always tried to impress upon new electrical members all the ways previous cars systems sucked, even to the point of exaggeration, and I know Sasha and Ben did too. Telling new folks that they are going to make a minor rev of mostly perfect electronics is not especially motivating. (at least not for me) .  Harry and Max both have plenty of humility, but I thought I have detected some of this way of thinking among other team members. If I am totally off base with this observation sorry for the tangent....

Secondly, while I think you are doing a great job so far of technical tradeoffs I am not sure I see good evidence of person hours to design and build each thing being properly weighed. Its really easy to get over your head. The mechanical aspects of the car are require an incredible amount of person hours to do the due diligence involved in design and manufacture. Its really hard to appreciate how vast a quantity of man hours is required unless you were very involved in a previous car. So make sure to factor this in when making design tradeoffs. For example, the amount of design it will take to correctly execute an asymmetric chassis and concentrator/array deployment is pretty terrifying. I know it took me from Aug->January to design the chassis for Luminos and I ended up on the 46th revision of the 12th version of a cad model with four hundred features! As chassis go the one for Luminos was about as easy as they get because I was copying a known good design, our car was huge, and there was nothing fancy that I had to make room for. NHS probably spent a similar amount of time because even though he had already built one cary by this point!!!! (packaging in Xenith was a lot more challenging than Luminos).  Doing a good job on an asymmetric chassis that had to fit/deploy concentrators is potentially a big step up in complexity beyond our previous efforts.&#x20;

I trust that you all can make good decisions regarding if concentrators are technically worth it, but you will need to hammer out a significant amount of detail regarding deployment strategy, concentrator type, and location asap.&#x20;

I don't think doing concentrators is a bad idea, or outside your abilities, but it will be if you don't take the challenge seriously enough early enough. I think you guys have the right talent, resources, and experience to make it happen but every part of the team will really have to step up asap to make it happen. Of the 10+ cars that I can think of that have had concentrators over the last 20 years all concentrator systems except the one on Nuna 7 were miserable failures.&#x20;

Sorry for the long email,&#x20;

From Logan Herrera:

Next generation EE here. I can confirm perceiving the next system as a minor rev of mostly perfect electronics. A contributing factor is that the "Compile list of everything \[electrical] that was wrong with Luminos" task has made no progress.

Without a major design effort somewhere in the system, the specter of a talent hole is very real. I am partial to BMS, but that is up for debate.

In short, Greg's EE remarks are insightful.

From Guillermo Gomez:

I think our challenge with electrical design is that we need more people like Logan who express a strong interest and then act on it.&#x20;

Logan, I know I'm impressed by your EE skills, especially as a freshman/new member. It's good that you want to take on some design work.&#x20;

In regards to the talent hole, our recruitment techniques don't work as well for talking to singular individuals who are very good at what they study (namely EE in this case).

If recruiting is something you feel you could help with as well, Logan, that would make a big difference for the electrical design philosophy the team is able to follow. You are likely more in touch with other electrical engineering undergraduates than older team members or non-EE majors.&#x20;

From Harry Johnson:

I agree that from what I've heard and seen, the number of electrical people who really get things done tends to be fairly small, and I think that's partly to do with team management and recruitment issues, and partly to do with the scope of the project. From last cycle forward the faults in management rest solely on me, starting with how I (for expediency's sake) steamrolled through the second half of the Luminos cycle to produce a working electrical system on time for testing, instead of investing the time to let newer members work. While this did produce a system that saw us through WSC well, it came at the expense of learning opportunities for people besides me. My approach this cycle is, in response, nearly the polar opposite: I've been trying to stay hands-off from the board-level design work (I get a bunch of that at work anyway). Instead of planning a major revamp of the system, I've been trying to cherrypick projects that show clear room for improvement (or require changes to meet the new rules) based on some gut-instinct balance of race performance benefit, educational benefit, and time availability of newer members, skewing conservative to ensure that at all times we have a working system while moving towards compliance with the new regulations. I also think that I sometimes forget that even though it could result in a nearly identical board, it's still that new person's first time making that board.&#x20;

Regarding Recruitment and Training:

Because I've not been on campus and as such don't have significant recruiting power through meeting classmates, I've been lax on general recruiting, more so than I should have, preferring to assign tasks based on who shows up and seems willing to work on stuff. I am also historically bad at managing and motivating/exciting people who don't have a strong internal drive and some degree of experience, so I think it's difficult to get people over the initial hurdles: Altium installation and learning curve, the frustrations of the first time doing real design work, and the like. I haven't yet figured out how to get truly new people (say E40 level or below, or really anyone who has never done PCB design/layout before) past that without feeling like I'm either walking them through in baby steps (in which case they aren't really doing the design, and they don't seem to get that sense of accomplishment) or telling them to RTFM, neither of which are pleasant or in the end productive experiences for anyone.  Either way, this fault is on me: I need to be better at motivating and teaching completely new people to bring them up to a state where they can be working on projects that will be educational to them and useful to the team.&#x20;

Team Size/Philosophy:

The downside of doing Challenger class is that the Electrical philosophy necessary to do well in it is, in my opinion, somewhat restrictive. The ideal electrical system for a Challenger car is reliable, hard to break due to user error, takes no quiescent draw, has maximum efficiency at all stages between the panels and the motor spinning, and reports its data in a usable format for strategy. There isn't that much room that I see for exciting new technologies without sacrificing one or more of those ideals. The current electrical system, while deeply flawed in the "takes no quiescent draw" category, seems be relatively well executed in the other categories (well, besides the telemetry server and rear view combo, which is the most obvious area for improvement). As I see it, this leaves this team with two choices if we want to have a plethora of projects available to take on: Redesign from the ground up, or drill down into the absolute nitty gritty of every single aspect of the system to reduce quiescent draw and boost efficiency. The former works but increases the chances of failure if we design ourselves out of being able to use the old electrical system as a backup, while the latter is not terribly exciting to many people (besides the rear-view system and the Vicor quiescent, the power draw in Luminos is very distributed and there are precious few good low-hanging fruits for newer people).  I've been trying to keep the new electrical components backwards compatible to lessen the first problem, but the second remains difficult.&#x20;

Having sufficient motivated and experienced enough team members that we could be confident that a complete re-design (or even re-architecturing) would be successful could change my current philosophy, but as it stands currently I dislike the idea because having had a personal hand in the design of many of the boards for Luminos, I'm in no rush to do so again for another car; a prospect I'm afraid of if the design team members suddenly decide they have other things they want to be doing, or work significantly more slowly than expected to the degree that they become the critical path to drivability and testing (that being said, both of those would be in the end team management failures on my part).&#x20;

&#x20;

Let me know if you think that I'm completely off base, have my head stuck up my ass, etc with the above thoughts.

As for what the electrical system would like like in 2-3 generations, I have absolutely no idea. I feel like that is going to be heavily determined by what the WSC officials deem required, and they only ever seem to move in the direction of forcing more and more inelegant decisions upon us.

From Ben Stabler:

To add my $0.02,

It seems that everyone is in agreement that they want to (1) further the electrical design and get as many new members involved as possible (2) without compromising the teams ability to race on a reliable electrical system.

Great! In that case let's improve on the model which we've been using (successfully) for the past few years. We have a modular electrical system, even 'redesign from the ground up' doesn't necessarily preclude (2) because we can swap boards as needed. High level decisions like switching to <60V need to be made by existing team members, but even those don't kill (2) because 90% of BMS could be the same, most other systems would be only marginally affected, and only a few (lights?) would need full redesigns.

At the same time, there are dozens of projects (MPPTs, telemetry, pressure or other sensors, motor controllers, rear view camera but talk to me if you want to do this with a STM32F4) which are deeply interesting and fulfill (1). As has been said, you don't actually need a large team to have people doing interesting projects, generally one highly motivated person can succeed at many small projects or one or two harder projects. As has also been said, you can't recruit freshmen by giving them hard projects, but really Max or Harry or Sasha are likely to be the ones working closely with new recruits, and people like Logan are going to be doing the hard projects.

So, conclusion, rearchitect=make system change and update existing boards to support it (not a big time sink for experienced members), redesign=incremental, continue with proven approach of allowing team members to tackle interesting problems, continue to try and improve ourselves wrt recruiting, existing system is a better backup than we've ever had before.

Ben

From Rachel Fenichel:&#x20;

As I mentioned at the design review, I think it could also be valuable to look for EE projects that do not have to be on the car that can add significant value.  The mechanical team gives out jobs like designing and building test jig (rolling resistance, etc) as real, solid projects to new members.  The electrical team probably has some analogous projects--off the top of my head I can say that having a non-hack way to test BMSes as they are being made would be immensely useful, as would having a board that can throw CAN messages onto the bus repeatedly for debugging.

Last cycle we steered strongly toward calling any project a lulzproject if it did not go directly on the car and make the car go faster all the time.  This was valuable at the time because we needed the focus, but the team could go back and consider some of those lulzprojects and see if they do have value from an infrastructure and testing perspective.  A few that have fallen into that category include wireless tire pressure sensing and a board that can record and play back CAN messages onto the bus, possibly powering the bus so that BMS is not required.  We have also considered having a board with an e-ink display that shows some information about the car from the last time it was on--not something that we would have on the car in its race configuration, when telemetry will be continuously monitored, but potentially useful during development.

Testing and infrastructure can make the car go faster in the end and make the team's life less painful, so these projects have real value.  The backup for these systems is just to not have them, so you don't have to have two people simultaneously designing any of these boards just to make sure that the car can drive in the end.  As long as the team actually puts value on them, new members will too.

From NHS:

+1 to Harry's well-thought-out response. But now a couple comments:

Remember that a project that is undertaken for the sole purpose of education usually does not carry sufficient motivation for the project's completion.

For example, if a board is redone "for educational purposes," then once education stops (at the 95% done mark), then the motivation is gone and the project is left unfinished. I can't put in one email all of the projects that have suffered from this over the years.

While the correct solution to the problem is one of the great mysteries of project management, one method that can help solve the problem is to tie each project to a set of metrics that could increase car performance. For Luminos, Wesley and Greg did a great job of explaining how projects could directly increase the reliability of the car, a goal which worked rather well.

In the context of a board redesign, a poor goal would be "redesign a board for education." A better goal would be "redesign a board to reduce power consumption by 80%." The best goal would be "redesign a board to reduce power consumption by 80% and radiated EMI by two orders of magnitude so that the telemetry system is more reliable" The last goal is superior because the project goals are directly important to other team members (whose systems might rely in low amounts of EMI).

No-one joins solar car with the experience needed to design things to SSCP's standards. One of the most rewarding challenges of leadership at SSCP is engineering the project in such a way that new members can rise to the challenges inherent in racing a solar car.

From John Bolander:

There have been some insightful comments and I think every one has made some great points. Now a bit of what I have heard/seen:

I feel like it might be getting harder to attract strong EE talent. People that want to do hardware love the challenge and ability to create what they want. In years past solar car might have given them an outlet to spend money, but there are many other avenues for this now. The EE department is very open to students doing projects and the robotics club will throw money at students to blow things up. I talked to several students building an electric go-kart. Why did they not want to join solar car? Because they wanted to do a project start to finish on their own.

So I think we should consider where does solar car fit into the plethora of opprotunities? How can you attract amazing talent without having projects suitable to their own creative drive and thirst for a challenge? Why would someone join solar car when they can build a quad copter?

I've always thought that one great thing solar car offers is the mentorship. It's what kept me around, and it's what keeps the team going. In addition, I feel like teaching and inspiring the next generation is one of the teams core values (maybe i'm mistaken here?). In the grand scheme of things, the most important thing solar car produces are the members.

I say this because this is why i made such an effort to give many people the opprotunity to contribute something. There are many things i would have done differently, but i feel like i did a good job keeping critical projects with dependable people. While some lolz projects never went anywhere, most members contributed at least something or told friends about it. Toby was working on a non-critical project before i pushed him to take on the array. The way i did things may not have been best, but i think some of it was ok.

Training someone from scratch is hard! And keeping them on top of their work and motivated is even harder! I always broke the problem into very small steps:

1. Primary part selection. I would narrow the list of ICs to 1-3 and they'd have to decide and say why.
2. Lt spice simulation, preferably under stress conditions.
3. Auxilary part selection.
4. Altium schematic
5. Part placement.
6. Routing.
7. Contruction
8. Testing

To go to the next step i had to design review their work. Naturally lots of mistakes were made a long the way. Before the next section i would give them general advice and point them to a google site page. I felt it was a good mix of handholding and rtfm.

I'd love to help with recruitment and early stage training! I actually enjoy the inspiration and encouragement you can give. Please let me know how i can help/point people in my direction for some initial prep.

All the way from China,

John
