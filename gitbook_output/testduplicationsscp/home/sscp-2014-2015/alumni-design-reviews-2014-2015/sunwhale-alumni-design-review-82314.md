Design Review 8/23/14

“Alumni Grill & Chill”

alumni in attendance

Paul Karplus, Ben Stabler, Matt Lambert, Rachel Fenichel, Wesley Ford, Sam Lenius, Adem Rudin, Wyles Vance, Nathan Hall-Snyder

aero schedule → move back towards december, in conversation w/ christensen about dates

look into bayview

backup option

or faster molds (but possibly for higher price)

good relationship w/ christensen currently to maintain

fitting driver

knees interfering with steering wheel, pedal fit (knees can only go up to 90 degrees)

fairing size driven around driver v wheel volume

getting dimensions & envelopes correct in earlier (first) model, before optimization

driver hip width

“driver durability training” with waterjet wood chassis panels a la umnsvp

seeing how humans fit, accommodating if necessary

wider pool of drivers to choose from rather than narrowing driver selection early

drivers can make a difference

know what wheel base is

design around those mechanical constraints

motors

front wheel drive

better for oversteer

turning wheel envelope encompasses motor width

reduce cable length between battery pack and motors

$5500/stator to make new stators

figure out when we want to be driving, back out motor manufacture date

get sam battery configuration decision by ^ see above

“intangible reliability bonus” from using the current motors, well-tested

w/ black edition motors limited to 55.1mph (88.7kph) at nominal pack voltage.

LYK SLOTH. TOO SLOW.

motors intended to be used upright. if change, brake caliper location needs to change on part (for location of air bubbles) → would only really matter in trailing arm geometry

would need to re-machine front faces of motors

2-3 month lead

battery pack

nickel plated copper for tab welding bp - ask nathan golshan (from work at tesla)

concentrators

semprius “already working with a team”. can’t. get. direct.

nuna modified containing tub & thinner optics, for weight

normal pack comes w/ballast checks out

to acquire semprius concentrators:

- contact a project developer for concentrator solar farm installation, to acquire from them

          ask semprius about who other customers are

- approach as a non-solar-car-interest

          solar decathlon ?!

          or another outside interest, interested in comparison

“so solar trackers don’t actually sit tanning all day”

they deal with winds/vibration, so should be a little more durable than we were originally thinking - matt lambert

sacrifice ~¼ cell in terms of area

reflectors

mylar sheet or something to that effect

questionably interpet-ate “permanently connected to car”

decal

ugh ugh ugh has to fit on front of car s;elij;fijse

array

sunpower no longer officially sponsoring teamsz

but the president emeritus visited our shop on thursday ;))

and they “don’t control their supply chain very well”

→ but we can’t guarantee getting them for free again this year

nothing better than Luminos E60’s on the line

but keep probing them for info as we work with them

to see if anything new coming out of lab that we can get a few of

benefits of going with sunpower

good cells

possibility of using their lab for encapsulation (!!)

would we have to / want to use their encapsulation materials?

panasonic

talk first about batteries, and then bring up cells

encapsulation material - the best we’ve tested is the special 3M stuff we used on Luminos

but 3M doesn’t make it anymore so we’d have to find other sources

Suncat? Minne-so-ta?

glass

significant work and optimization possible with A/R coatings on glass, to get better power over range of angles (instead of direct, which is hardly ever seen)

probably too late to look into glass, but might be worth emailing

the very nice lady at Corning (who called the vp by satellite phone on

yacht to get approval for stopping iphone tooling line to make xenith array glass. boom.)

SunCat array

$ per watt figure - what’s a good benchmark / decision to justify this?

kind of booked up but we could really pursue that option…?!

won’t send us sample material but we can send someone to his lab to test

(aero burritos $ per watt is probably pretty low)

tires

michelins: look into sourcing

supplier constraints

get them now before they buy out

$ per performance - can corner the market!

did we look into bridgestone’s new encopias?

max’s vicor replacement (DC/DC converter)

55-150W input, 24W out

(sefelianna stopped taking notes after this)
