Hi Guillermo,

I don't know if you have met me before. I was the aerodynamicist for Xenith. I still get the e-mails for the team, but I don't seem to have permissions to send out team-wide e-mails, so I'll just send this to you. I looked over the pictures of the decision board once the rules were posted a couple of weeks ago. I thought I would offer a few points:

I would strongly suggest switching to an asymmetric catamaran design for the next car. There are a number of advantages, including a flatter array, the possibility of running a  2-D curve array which could use the gorilla glass construction from Xenith (which was a phenomenal array both in energy collected and aerodynamic efficiency, even though it was a pain to manufacture), and overall less aerodynamic wetted area on the car. There is a reason that the top teams chose this route. While a symmetric body is easier, it's also going to keep Stanford in the second tier of teams.

With Xenith, we found that rear wheel steering really wasn't worth it. We never really used it during the race because it offered almost no advantage with less than a 5 degree cross-wind. I would anticipate the same will be true for the next car. The complication and compromised suspension geometry probably isn't worth it.

One of the ideas that I discussed with Sam, and Nathan H.S. a while ago is active boundary layer control for the aerodynamics. Some back-of-the-envelope calculations that I did a while ago showed it has the potential to save 145W at cruising speed while only using about 1W of power for the fan.

Of course, it won't be this good in reality, but it probably will still be significant. There has been a bit of research done on this with gliders and it has indeed significantly reduced drag. Actually implementing this will require a very large investment in design, analysis, and wind-tunnel testing. For that reason, I don't think it should be targeted for the 2015 car, but instead should be targeted for the 2017 car. The key is to get it started now though. Possibly the best way to go about it is to build a second 2015 shell out of fiberglass for this testing. That shell would not have any internal parts, but would only be used for wind-tunnel testing and refinement of the active boundary layer control system. Thus it could be made with far less effort and a reasonable cost.&#x20;

Xenith was a very ambitious car, and we payed for it with mistakes and reliability issues. Aerodynamically, it's also a very misunderstood car. I made several key errors along the way, but they're not the mistakes most people presume I made. There has been quite a bit of misinformation going around regarding that car in the last few years. Luminos, understandably, was a much more conservative and tested design, which the team needed, but it was never going to have the performance to compete for first place. Something in the middle is going to be needed this time.

You can do with this information as you see fit. I live in San Francisco now, but if there is a specific aerodynamics layout or conceptual design meeting you would like me to attend, I might be able to swing it depending on the day.
