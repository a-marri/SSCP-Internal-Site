# Driver Preparation 2014-2015

I haven't talked to any of you guys since the test driving yesterday so I'm not sure if this has already been discussed, but in case it hasn't -- here are driver packing items to consider. Let me know if anything has changed; I haven't been around for any Arctan driving yet so this is just from past experience.

> water, as hands-free as possible (during the raced we strapped a camelback bladder to a chassis shelf behind the driver and we could just drink out of the hose. alternatively a water bottle with a straw. ideally not a water bottle where you have to unscrew anything)

> close toed shoes - race regs, they won't let you drive in flip flops

> in-ear headphones - plug into the radio and make it a lot easier for you to hear radio comm. would recommend just putting in one ear, so you can still hear noises coming from the car.

> ballast - maybe not as important for this drive, but eventually drivers are responsible for their own ballast. You should know how much you have (each driver on the race has their own tagged bag) and make sure that it gets swapped into the car whenever you're driving.

> sunglasses - hopefully this bubble is better than the Luminos one in this regard, but later in the afternoon / early in the morning when the sun's low in the sky, any scratches or deformities get super reflective. also just for glare from the road because bubble's not coated for that (afaik)

other things from last cycle:

The solar car radio + helmet should always stay together, preferably in the car (when car's not in the trailer) -- easy for one person to get out and set down somewhere else, and a waste of time to look for every time.Â 

Be mindful of your water intake because heatstroke/dehydration is a very real thing and probably one of the biggest, most constant, and most unexpected risks you'll face. Also speak up if you're don't feel comfortable about anything. Your safety is #1

also don't drink water or caffeine to excess though because you'll have to pee your pants before we stop the convoy for the solar car driver to bathroom :)
