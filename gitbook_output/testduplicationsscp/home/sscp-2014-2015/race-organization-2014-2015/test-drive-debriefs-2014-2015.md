Debrief

Good things:

200 miles on car!

Good spirits coming back to shop

Good driving all around

People took things seriously

Once on the road, actual convoy driving worked pretty well

Bad things:

200 miles on car (in the sense that we need 2x that a day for race)

Overall, everything needs to happen faster, from getting in and out of cars to quick stops

Needs to be better logistically organized beforehand (e.g. rides, weather, car assignments, routes)

Things like schedule, roles, and standards of living were not well-communicated beforehand

Careful with convoy vehicles

Moving Forward (i.e. a collection of things that were decided on in discussion)

Overall: better communication, task-delegation, and planning for better efficiency

Driving

Be more spatially aware (e.g. blocking driveways, causing someone to cut around you)

Know routes and turnarounds ahead of time

Leave space between trailing vehicle and chase for other people to merge into convoy

Pack anomaly is cause for instant driving stop, get it out of car faster

Helpers should be in scout, then lead, NOT chase

Better driver briefing, e.g. cruise control, things to watch out for in car

Radio

Always leave a driver in the car with a radio

Radio awareness → establish radio checks on :00 and :30s

Communicate INTENT and LENGTH of each stop

Speak clearly without negatives, try to keep messages to fewer than six words

Get used to juggling both inter and intra convoy radioing

General

Clear chain of command, who makes final decisions

JAMIE is official race crew lead, point person for test drives

“This is not a consensus-building team.”  

If someone tells you to stay in the car, stay in the car

Listen to people: safety is priority, communications can be slow afterwards

Don’t hold up the convoy

Keep track of your belongings (e.g. laptops, chargers, phones, etc.) \

Be prepared to pee in a bottle, convoy will not stop for you

Simulate race conditions as much as possible, rely less on cell service and internet

Put things back where they need to go

Once protocols are established, follow them in a quick, disciplined manner

Sometimes the best thing to do at a stop is to stay in the car

ALWAYS have someone knowledgeable paying attention to critical components, e.g. battery

Take care of yourself! You know how much to hydrate, what you need to sleep well, etc.

Don’t use your personal knife on communal food

Be careful with array, make sure non-team members stay outside a 10ft diameter of car

No hats, cameras, water bottles when walking around car

Courtesy alert: buy something from stores in which we squat in their parking lots

To Do

Plan next test drive...better

Prepare binders, one for each car → start now! Have alumni / older members check IN PERSON

Checklists (mech, electrical, driving readiness)

Protocols (safety, general convoy information)

Critical parts and failure modes, i.e. are we fucked without this / if this happens\

Electrical packing, consolidating into “chase box” 

Get general packing list checked

PRINT everything (lists, schedules, car groupings, etc.)

Add - ??? - to telemetry (sorry this was before I started taking notes)

Check array structural issues (Darren is emailing John, something about clear nail polish)

Array waterproof test after Harry is done wiring the array

To Acquire

Shelves in van

Folding table for battery work

Radio chargers (?)

Pelican cases for electrical

Atlases / road maps

Silicone-tip earbuds for drivers

Torque wrench(es)

Other critical parts
