# SSCP - Battery Pack Voltage

# Battery Pack Voltage

This issue was also addressed by the mechanical team.

[ addressed by the mechanical team](/stanford.edu/testduplicationsscp/home/sscp-2014-2015/mechanical-2014-2015/mechanical-team-projects/2014-2015-battery-pack-design)

A lower pack voltage uses 20kg of cells slightly better and has some electrical system advantages, especially if the highest pack voltage is less than 60V, the WSC threshold for a high-voltage system.

Any of these advantages are small in comparison to the effort required to redesign the motors for a lower pack voltage. Thus, the sunwhale pack configuration will be 24x17, 99.9V - 67.5V.
