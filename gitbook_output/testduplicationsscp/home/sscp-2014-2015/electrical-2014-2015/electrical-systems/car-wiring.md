## Array Wiring

[](#h.q3b8b3d14qgh)

Rough Array Tab Drop-Through locations are attached below. This results in the following grommet hole punch count. Note that Starboard-Aft being 0 is correct; unless we want to cut a hole in that bulkhead we'll have to run wires underneath the lip of the top shell aft of the door. Also attached below is the array_drop_through_locations zip file, which contains labelled drawings of the three wheel wells with array flat wiring drop-throughs.

## LED (Head/Tail Lights) Wiring

[](#h.mxyompbndxs8)

NO CONNECTIONS ARE TO BE MADE TO THESE WIRES EXCEPT BY HARRY (harrymj@)

IF THE LEDS BREAK, WE HAVE TO CUT APART THE CAR.

### Grommets

[](#h.irdnouud7hz8)

We used the GS2003-5 (1" rubber diameter) and GS50328-BL  (1.55" rubber diameter) from Seals-it. They are punched using the red-handled punch in the white electrical bench center drawer, then glued directly to holes cut in the chassis. For more bombproofing, we also edge-filled the holes in the chassis after they were cut. This worked out with mixed results: The edge-fill added a decent amount of dimension, which had to be removed with a Dremel with cylinder attachment on the sides where the grommets were to be glued. Grommet locations and a rough description of associated wires are described in a PDF that is attached below. 

### Zip Tie Mounts

[](#h.d61du7m5f0v6)

We use a variety of glue-on ziptie mount made by Click Bond. One-Way mounts only allow a ziptie to be installed in one axis, so must be installed with care to avoid cables having to suddenly make right angle bends. Two-Way mounts do not have this problem, and as such may be installed with relative impunity. 

Installation is simple. Standard surface prep of carbon (abrade->solvent clean), just solvent clean for the mount. Apply dab of glue of choice (DP460 is best for all non-urgent applications) to the mount. For the large mount, when dispensed from a glue gun the bead of glue should be just larger than the small circle that can be seen on the bottom of the mount. For the small mount, the appropriate size is really just a small bead. Once glue has been applied, remove the backing from the adhesive on the mount's mounting frame, stick the frame to the desired location on the carbon, then press in on the center plastic section of the frame. That adhesive will be used to locate the zip tie mount while the main epoxy cures. Wait appropriate cure time (typically ~24 hours for DP460) then snap off the plastic frame to reveal a gloriously solid zip tie mount underneath.
