Four Issues with an assymetrical car

Suspension

Steering

Tire Wear and Braking

Rolling

Steering

* Always need to apply a counter-steering measure. would cause drag, extra burden on driverWhat about a steering wheel encoder that creates a torque differential proportional to the offset angle of the steering wheel from the 0 degree mark?Focus on reducing steering and steering column play so that angle measurements can be smoothSteering may not be a simple Ackerman geometry. Torque vs. steering position code needed

Focus on reducing steering and steering column play so that angle measurements can be smooth

Steering may not be a simple Ackerman geometry.&#x20;

Suspension

* Vertical motion should be parallel to ground. Make suspension stiffness proportional to weight distribution.&#x20;

Tire Wear and Braking

* Distribute braking force with a 60/40 front/rear split and a lateral split proportional to the weight imbalance.&#x20;

* Use multiple balance bars for brake system&#x20;

Rolling

* Biggest un-addressed issue is car rolling. An asymmetrical car will be more likely to roll to one side than the other. Yaw rate gyro on car, 3-axis accelerometer?&#x20;

To-Do

* Simulate assymetrical CG on 4-wheel planar model used by ME 227Investigate steering wheel encoders or small stepper motor encodersTake into consideration potential non-Ackerman steering geometry in choosing a steering rack.

* &#x20;Do more simulation to get info on compensation for steady-side winds
* Set up ME113 capstone design credit for a few ME team members. 5 to 12 is the range. Class is normally in the spring, could use a qualifying project to get same credit even if it takes more than one quarter to finish.&#x20;
* Guillermo: Review how many brake calipers are needed for new car
