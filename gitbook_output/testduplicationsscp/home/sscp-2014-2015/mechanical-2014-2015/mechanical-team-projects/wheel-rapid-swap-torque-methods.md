# SSCP - Wheel Rapid Swap Torque Methods

# Wheel Rapid Swap Torque Methods

This mechanical sub-team project (owned by Richard) aims to make installation and removal of wheels a much more race-rapid process. One idea is to replace the manual torque wrench with an electric torque wrench that can match the 80 ft-lb setting required. This alone would drastically speed up the removal of the wheel nuts. For installation, it is also necessary to facilitate the process of aligning the wheel to the proper aluminum dowels. Currently this process is a manual guess-and-check affair that takes too long and exposes the wheel to the danger of not slipping on entirely before the installer attempts unsuccessfully to screw on the wheel nut. 

Hey Richard,

That torque comes a couple back-of-the-envelope calculations as well as experience with thread galling.

The calculations assume a couple things: 

- We never want the dowel pins that locate the rim to take bump load. The pins are a last ditch mechanical stop so that the brakes work even if the nut loosens. This would imply that the rim could move relative to the spindle. We never want this to occur, so we would like all load to be transferred through the rim/spindle face. Previous designs transferred loads through the dowel pins and had dangerous problems.

- The worst case load is a 4g*.7 bump with no cornering.

- Cornering only changes the pressure distribution on the rim/spindle interface and not the absolute   pressure. I can explain this in more detail when I get back from Peru.

- The aluminum/titanium interface has a friction coefficient of .4

- Ignore the 45 deg interface of the wheel but and any non-axial force transmitted through the threads. 

- Other assumptions about friction coefficients, material properties, etc.

Using bolt torque tables with the above assumptions, I arrived at the 80 ft-lbs number with some safety factor. (I don't remember what it was off the top of my head). When I get back I'll hunt down my calcs.

The Ducati spec for the same nut (though made out of steel instead of aluminum like ours) is 171 ft-lbs, which is extremely high for our application and might cause undue suffering. Our number doesn't gall/damage the threads, nut, or wheels and (I think) hasn't caused problems.
