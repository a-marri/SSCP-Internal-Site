## SSCP - Sunwhale Brake System

## Sunwhale Brake System

The Sunwhale brake system will exactly mirror the brake system used on Luminos. Here's some information on that system:

Here's the parts list from an email I sent awhile back. Ordering these items should result in the hardware you need to put brakes together. Wesley has good advice about the pad type - we should just use what we used before. I've added some more information about the wheel nuts and clips.

A couple things to note:

* I believe there are new versions of the Shimano rotors that we used (RT77) (These do not work for our purposes as they are very rare)
* We can actually use any bicycle calipers - the mounting patterns are the same for all. The Hayes ones are simply preferable because we haven't had any problems with them at any time.
* Don't assume that we have enough tubing - you need enough contiguous tubing to run the entire distance. It's cheap, so it's always better to have more.
* I'm not a fan of the 180mm rotors due to the post-machining that's required. I would investigate options for replacing the smaller rotors with ones that require less modification. The 203 mm rotors are perfect - the only operation that's required is drilling out the center carrier. The current spindle design is intended for the 203mm rotors.
* I don't want this to be the first car since I've been at Stanford that has brake problems. I don't mind coming in and helping the team design and/or assemble the brake system. There are a number of tricks that make it go smoothly and safely.

Per wheel:

1x Shimano RT-78 203mm (front) or Shimano RT-78 180mm (rear) (I would revise the rear to a new rotor, such as the RT-77)

1x Wheel nut: http://www.ducabike.com/dpr01-dadi-posteriori-731.html (sometimes available on ebay)

1x Wheel clip: http://www.ducatimcparts.com/products/Ducati/Diavel750/Clip-REAR-WHEEL-NUT-CLIP-1098S08/3493151/759.1.022.2A.html (buy lots since they're cheap and easy to lose)

Per two wheels:

Jagwire HyFlow Quick-Fit Formula ORO. Each one of these terminates four&#x20;

Jagwire Hyflow Universal Tubing,  (blue). Do not use orange, since orange is required for high voltage lines.
