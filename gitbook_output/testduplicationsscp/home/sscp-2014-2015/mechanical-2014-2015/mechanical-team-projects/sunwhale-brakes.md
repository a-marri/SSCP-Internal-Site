Copied Tip from Wesley:

Brake fluid readily absorbs moisture from the air, so you always want to use unopened bottles of brake fluid when you fill or flush a brake system. If you use an old bottle of brake fluid from last cycle it is liable to have water in it even if the cap appears to be screwed on.

I can't recall what we did with the brake fluid bottles after we filled Luminos's brakes. If there are any opened bottles of brake fluid in the shop you should dispose them with EH&S, and buy new bottles of DOT 4 fluid or whatever brake fluid type your brake master cylinder and calipers require.

If there are left over bottles that still have their tamper-proof seal on you are probably fine to use them.
