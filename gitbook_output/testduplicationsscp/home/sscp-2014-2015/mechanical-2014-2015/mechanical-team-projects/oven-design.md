Our proposed timeline for the construction of the oven:

* December 1: Finalize design and material choices
* February 7: Begin construction of oven
* Late February/Early March: Finish oven construction
* Early March: Aero body molds arrive
* Week of March 1: Begin running oven tests to practice getting the oven to temperature
* Week of March 21 (Spring Break): Composite layups for aero body, fairings, door, etc
* April 13-20: Oven disassembly and disposal

The oven for this cycle will likely be very similar to the oven use for Luminos. Areas of possible improvement:

* Finding new insulation material that can withstand elevated temperatures near the heatersDesign a floor to reduce heat loss through the concrete heat sinkThe 2015 oven has a floor made of 3/4" plywood and 2x4s on their side running underneath where the wheels of the mold will apply lots of pressure.  We put fiberglass batting underneath the plywood in the air-gap (we also put some in the door frames). Changing door design to a single side-hinge door to reduce the number of gapsTo fix this, we kept the barn-style doors and used weatherstripping tape to create an air-tight seal in the door jams. Tip for mounting doors: place two 3/4" plywood sheets underneath the doors when mounting hinges so that you have plenty of ground clearance. &#x20;
