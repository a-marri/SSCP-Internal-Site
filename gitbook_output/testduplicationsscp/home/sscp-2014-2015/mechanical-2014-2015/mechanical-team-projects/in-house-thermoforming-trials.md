Heat: Inner zones (1,2,3) -  90, Outer zones (4,5,6,7) - 70

Time: 360 seconds

Center sags, formed fold when formed

Not optically clear

Likely issues:

Waited too long to pull (huge fold)

Tiny trapped air bubbles (need more/smaller holes for vacuum)

Appears to be tiny panes of clear area (possibly a thermo effect due to cold aluminum)

Trial 2:

Preheated Aluminum Buck (5min 150F, 5min 250F oven)

Heat: All blocks 80

Time effects:

60s - edge sags, center bubbles up

90s - soft M shape

150s - 2 main bumps beginning to level off, center fold forms

200s - took heaters off to inspect (fold is probably unsavable), move mold to edge so it             won't be under fold

&#x20;       300s - back into heater

&#x20;       400s - pulled vacuum

vacuum broken bc edge had sagged in too much, so didn't really form. However, where PETG did contact the aluminum, was optically clear (either from preheating the block or lack of air bubbles ability to appear)

Looking forward:

1. preheat buck
2. determine correct heating/timing (probably need slower, more even (?) heating
3. More vacuum holes (if necessary)&#x20;

After some number of trials and error, the final process for 1/16'' PETG is as follows:

* Preheat buck inside thermoformer (for the back windscreens, this is \~30 min with heat at 90 all around)Clean plastic (water, then microfiber cloth, then compressed air to get the lint off)After buck is warm to touch, thermoform plastic with heat settings on 50 everywhere (should take \~70-100seconds)Keep vacuum and fan on for the full time.Only remove buck from piece when both are cooled.

Troubleshooting:

"Mysterious Warping" was fixed with an extra small hole in the buck to improve vacuum.

Pinprick imperfections are fixed with buck heating.

Lint imperfections are fixed with water rinse + microfiber cloth + compressed air dry.
