# Protective Films

Some photos attached below --putting them on the site made the page too large.

The 3M Scotchgard is a paint protector designed for cars, not necessarily optical clarity.

The 3M 1004MS is a multi surface film protectant designed to adhere to plastic/other non-glass things, usually used on bus windows. It comes as a 4 layered film, of which each layer can be removed fairly easily. As expected, visual distortion gets progressively worse as we add more layers -- not really a problem until layer 3. More layers means a little harder to bend around the curves, but totally doable.
