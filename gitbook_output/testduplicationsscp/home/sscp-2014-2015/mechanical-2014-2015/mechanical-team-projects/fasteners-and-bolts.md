### Pro Tips from NHS

[](#h.gocwqk3lst6i)

* Use Torx drive whenever possible even to the extent of forcing the design. You'll thank yourself later when you don't have to drill out a stripped bolt.Use high strength bolts not only because of the needed loads weaker bolts are easily damaged by repeated removal.Throw away bolts after each use. The lubricious coating on most bolts is destroyed after the first installation so the torque properties will not be as consistent.Throw away distorted thread nuts after each use.

Throw away distorted thread nuts after each use.

* DO NOT USE CADMIUM PLATED FASTENERS ON TITANIUM!!!!!Follow the Bossard guide to determine what kind of fastener securingNever use stainless bolts unless the application requires it (cosmetic or non-magnetic) or the stainless is A286 super alloy.Never use black oxide bolts - they corrode and do not store well in the salty (ocean shipping) and humid environments of solar cars.Do not use set screws ever. They may only be used as a secondary locking technique - another feature must constrain the rotation of the shaft.
