# SSCP - Canopy construction

# Canopy construction

This is an item that the team has historically not addressed until later in the cycle, which as a result has led to sub-optimal results. For Sunwhale we're hoping to start researching processes, materials, and coatings earlier on so that we can have a quality canopy construction method established before it becomes a last-minute item.

Additionally, one point that was brought up during the 7/12/14 Preliminary Design Review was that the thermoforming process for the canopy needs to be known when making the aerobody CADs for the molds (currently slated for beginning of October).

Email from Wesley: Next solar car canopy

Stanford has struggled lately with making canopies that don't get scratched and that don't need a lot of polishing. During the spring I'd recommend trying to figure out a process that

can work well for the 2015 car using the Luminos mold (or another smaller mold piece). 

There are thermoformers who can successfully make large curved canopies for race car windscreens, motorcycle helmets, and (possibly) aircraft canopies. For example, I'd recommend contacting fivestarbodies.com.

You may also want to experiment with coatings for plastics that reduce their susceptibility to scratches. Check out SilFORT AS4000 and SilFORT FHC615.

Eliminating scratches in the next windscreen would do a lot to improve driver safety, driver visibility, and the looks of the car.

Relevant information on molds and composites on the site here.

Side note: From here on out let's try to consistently use the term "canopy" to refer this project/part of the car in text, to make it more searchable on the site and by email. (As opposed to "driver bubble," "windscreen," and other variations.) 

If there's a compelling reason to call it something else that's fine too, just change all mentions of "canopy" & then keep it consistent.

During the 7/12/14 Preliminary Design Review Greg also suggested looking into high-density tooling foam for making molds.

Total Number of Windows

                  3 = 1 large front windshield + 2 back/side windows following current pattern. The back windows are not technically necessary for the race (can use small hole for camera and possibly brake light) but is likely required to adequately display license plate. See http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/displaycode?section=veh&group=05001-06000&file=5200-5206

or

1 gigantic plastic bubble. Cons include that it is more difficult to manufacture and will likely be heavier than alternatives. Pro is simplicity of design.

 

Overall Installation

The last bubble was made using a male and female plug that were fit perfectly for each other but resulted in slightly offset PETG to carbon.

 

This cycle, I’d like to solve the offset by creating an inset in the carbon mold so that the windshield can just sit inside and fit perfectly for better flow. Presumably, the inset could be set and determined before the molds ship out so that the molds account for windshields.

 

The plastic windows could be made individually on smaller molds for possibly thinner/lighter windows since it must be as thick as it needs to be at mostly sharply deformed section.  Smaller molds could be made of tooling foam or aluminum (could possibly CNC ourselves).  

 

 

Material

Likely contenders are polycarbonate (industry motorcycle windshield standard) or PETG (what was on Luminos) again. This choice is likely going to be up to the thermoformer’s preference, but we can improve by using coatings for better scratch resistance and to fix issues with cloudiness.

 

Coatings

                  SilFORT AS4000 (suggested by Wesley) – Hardcoat. Tested for polycarb. Uses non-thermal curing primer (SHP401 Primer) but will require thermal curing.

 

                  SilFORT FHC615 (suggested by Wesley) – Hardcoat. UV Curable, but no data sheet online? Likely needs primer.

 

                  SilFORT UVHC5000 – Hardcoat. UV Curable. Needs primer. Has been used on polycarb for exterior lights.

                 

                  SilFORT PHC587C – Hardcoat. Does not need primer. Cures faster.

 

                  TSP Duravue 1500 – Hardcoat. UV and Thermal curing. Used for optical clarity in outdoor weather.

                  Quantum – Anodic Hardcoat. Used for super extra thin layer. Anodized – can make minimum 25um.

Manufacturing Costs

Mold Cost

Cost if we buy through Bell Plastics, the people doing the thermoforming.

FRP mold sanded to 400         $3,600.00

FRP mold polished                   $4,600.00

3 weeks

FOB Hayward, CA 94545

Plus sales tax 9%

1/2 down 1/2 COD

Thermoforming Cost

Response from Bell Plastics copied below. I think this is a good estimate for material thickness (1/8") given the shape of the windscreen that I sent (very similar to Luminos, curved surface that wraps around the front of the canopy), although final product will likely be either polycarb or PETG (NOT acrylic, not impact safe). 

Hi,

1 each solar car window. Stanford to provide a usable mold. Bell Plastics to supply materials, 1/8 clear acrylic.

$2,600.00

2 weeks from recite of mold.

FOB Hayward, CA 94545

Plus sales tax or sale tax exemption cert.

Payment with order.

I don't think polycarbonate will form to your shape. We will try a few pieces however if we can't form them from polycarbonate we will change to acrylic.

Total Cost

$6200 (400 sanded mold) or $7200 (polished mold) through Bell Plastics.

 Looking into buying Modulan from McCausey (http://www.mccausey.com/component/virtuemart/modulan-tooling-boards/obo-modulan-tooling-boards/53-156) to make the mold ourselves here, which could save us most of the cost of the mold. 

TIMELINE/TASKS

1. find out if insetted mold is possible

2. find thermoformer willing to help (Need to know approx thickness, time frame, cost, hardcoating?)

3. build into timeline

*****Questions to Answer by Nov. 1 2014

* How long would it take to machine something the size of the bubble out of Modulan?
* Who will machine this (Richard + Rob?) and when? Machining and thermoforming should happen after winter break, during early Winter quarter.
* Can sufficiently-large modulan be purchased such that the bubble is made out of one piece? Will one piece even fit in the CNC?
* Talk to PRL TA Dan to ask about thermoforming and methods to segment a mold into multiple pieces.

Determine inset on bubble mold -- see adhesive thickness (Lisa) + polycarb thickness (Rob)

contact companies to find out polycarb thickness

My personal preference would be to use either the Windshield epoxy or the vhb. VHB has the pro of simplicity/uniform thickness and no curing time for the windshield to slip. However, the vhb has the possibility of a having compression effects nad needs to be characterized to find an exact thickness to plan for. That being said, the windshield epoxy would allow for sliding and can be only funneled in from the side and set it that way to avoid planning for thickness. In addition, the epoxy can use glass beads for uniform thickness underneath.

Update 3/2/15

The bubble was shipped to Bell Plastics several weeks ago and is on its way. Molds for the back windows are currently being machined and we expect to thermoform them in the next 2 weeks. In-house thermoforming is all but perfected with exception of preventing dirt from sticking (but we expect to fix that with prewash and cleaning w compressed air) and waiting for PRL thermoformer to be fixed (within the next week).

Currently in contact with Coating Design Solutions (Bill Roy) and sending samples for primer and hardcoat confirmation.

Update 5/11/15

All received front windscreens are undersized.

Rear windscreens are already installed w DP100.
