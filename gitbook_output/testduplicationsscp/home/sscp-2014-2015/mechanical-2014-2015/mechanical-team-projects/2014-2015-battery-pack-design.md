## SSCP - 2014-2015 Battery Pack Design

## 2014-2015 Battery Pack Design

An asymmetrical car and a 1kg reduction in new regulation battery pack allowance will require (at minimum) a redesign of our battery pack form-factor.

This project could range from a simple re-arrangement and new box to fit in a new space to in-depth battery pack redesign. Ian Girard did the mechanicals for the Luminos battery pack, now works at Tesla (on batteries), and has expressed willingness to advise whoever takes this on.

More details & relevant links to come.&#x20;

If interested in this project, contact Anna, Max, or Darren.

For references, this is Luminos's documentation of battery pack voltage, which documents how the optimization of cells & layout was figured out. (Max is a good person to contact for more information if you have any questions here.)

* Step 1: get on PDM, get access to Luminos battery pack CADs
* Step 2: look at the Luminos doc on battery pack. perhaps make a new copy we can start editing for Sunwhale (link it here!)
* Step 3: look at module dimensions from past CAD and play around with new layouts in SolidWorks

Preliminary Subsystem Fitting Report:&#x20;

This is a rough fitting report to gauge how to best fit the pack in the side fairing.&#x20;

Preliminary Design Decisions

Here I go through the two best pack configurations and weight the pros and cons. I have concluded that we should stick with the same nominal bus voltage as Luminos (99.9 V).

Resistance-welded nickel metal of 0.010" gauge. Resistance welder borrowed from Mission Motors.&#x20;

Option A: We could borrow this resistance welder again.
