# Concentrator Collapsible Mechanism

Description

Collapsible enclosure for Arzon's concentrators (lens + solar cell combination) so that when deployed, the lens and cell are spaced by the focal length (19.6in) and properly aligned (±0.9°), while allowing for efficient use of space inside the car body for storing them while driving.
