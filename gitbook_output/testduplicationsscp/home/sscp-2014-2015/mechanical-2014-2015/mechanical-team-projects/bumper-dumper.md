# SSCP - Bumper Dumper

# Bumper Dumper

Over the course of the race, teams tend to see a high Kohler Number. While this is not a mission-critical mechanical project, we're hoping that addressing it early on in the cycle will give us ample time to come up with an optimal solution.

The Kohler Number is a non-dimensional constant that relates the number of bowel movements to instances of available facilities. The Bumper Dumper is a commercially available solution, but we should able to construct our own for lower cost and greater durability.

The first action item for this project will be to estimate the loads that this mechanism will experience, in addition to a consideration of the rugged conditions of the Outback. This will help inform our initial design decisions.
