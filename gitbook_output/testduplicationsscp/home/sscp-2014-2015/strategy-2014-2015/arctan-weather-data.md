# SSCP - Arctan: Weather Data

# Arctan: Weather Data

We use an Amazon EC2 account to fetch and process new forecasts during the race and Amazon S3 to store the resulting files. The code is divided between GitHub and SVN and our AWS account details are below:

[ ggomez2@stanford.edu](mailto:ggomez2@stanford.edu)

Note: In order to access our EC2 instance, you will need the key pair attached below (sscp_luminos.pem); rootkey.csv contains the access key and secret key for the solar car AWS. In order to run the weather code, Java and Matlab will need to be installed on the EC2 instance.

To ssh into the EC2 instance, once you've downloaded sscp_luminos.pem, type "ssh -i "sscp_luminos.pem" ubuntu@52.8.73.255" into your command line from the directory you've placed sscp_luminos.pem into.
