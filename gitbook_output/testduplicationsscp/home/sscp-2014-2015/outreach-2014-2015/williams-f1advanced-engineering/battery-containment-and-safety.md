# SSCP - Battery Containment and Safety

# Battery Containment and Safety

·         Williams advanced engineering battery case studies

o   Jaguar CX75

o   Formula E

§  200 kW maximum, 90 kW average power

§  32 kWh stored energy

§  610 nominal battery voltage

·         Battery design overview

o   Case Design

§  Impact Analysis

·         Create simplified model for analysis

·         Simulate front impact

·         Simulate side impact

·         Ensure battery containment structure integrity

§  Fire/heat protection

·         Battery fires up to 500 degC

·         Contain a thermal event

·         Guide a thermal event away from people

·         Reduce the amount of heat transferred to outer surface

§  Electrical Isolation

·         Provide electric shock protection external to the battery

·         During a misuse case high voltage parts could touch the battery box

·         Prevent electrical path to outside of battery case

o   Battery Internals

§  Installation Integrity    

·         If the battery is involved in a collision, the batteries stay in place

·         Deflection/stress caused by load case

§  Pack Monitoring: temp, voltage, pack balance, state of charge, coolant flow, current draw, isolation checks

§  Thermal Management

·         Extending battery life

·         Higher energy densities

·         Extended range

·         Improved endurance

·         Faster charging times

·         Improving safety and reliability

§  Thermal Runaway: external heating, overcharging, over-discharging, high current charging, nail penetration, crush, external short

§  High voltage Connections: finger proof, touch safe, no tool required to unmate, integrated internal HVIL, sealed

·         Testing and certification

o   In order to ensure air transportation safety, IATA require UN38.3 test report before transport the goods

§  Altitude simulation, thermal test, vibration, shock, external short circuit, impact, overcharge, forced discharge

* As soon as High Voltage (>50V by their standards) is present anywhere in any battery pack, Health and Safety regulations force the workers to wear large insulating rubber gloves, which greatly decrease dexterity. As such, a secondary but present design goal is to maximize the amount of manufacturing that can be done before connecting anything that results in said HV (typically many separate and small modules that only get connected at the very last step).
