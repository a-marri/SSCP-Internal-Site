## Design Reviews and Safety

Project Structure

o   Programme Manager ßà Technical Lead

§  Delivery Focused: timing, cost, specification/expectation

§  Technical Focused: engineering direction, concept direction, system level targets

o   Exterior/Interior, Chassis, Power Unit, Electrical, Dynamics, Packaging/BOM, Mechanical

§  Area focused: the leads are responsible for full quality, cost, delivery for their areas

§  The central BOM should show the allocation of responsibility clear with objective targets (cost, weight, maturation) that can be tracked clearly

§  It is the responsibility of the leads to allocate work load to the support members

o   Department Manager

§  Team focused: responsible for resource provision

·         Design Efficiency

o   Bill of Materials (BOM)

§  Skeleton 10% BOM created at outset

·         System level

o   Known components

o   Long-lead items

·         Mass budgets set for each system

·         Cost budget set

·         Procurement/mfg lead time

§  Lead engineers monitor system level mass and cost

§  Allow space to create concepts

·         Functional lead to agree when concept is added to BOM

§  BOM matured and monitored

§  Closely paired to CAD package

§  Owner for every component

o   Timing Plan

§  Major Events/Milestones

§  Right to left timing

·         Design freeze à procurement time à MRD (Materials Required Date) à Vehicle Build à Vehicle Test and Dev à Event

§  Design freeze is a clear objective for every design engineer for every component

§  Aim for a single MRD

o   Design Reviews

§  Biweekly

§  Topic focused

§  Wide audience at concept phase

§  Timed agenda inviting personnel for relevant topics

·         Not just a talking shop/brainstorm session

§  What is design objective? Target?

§  Objective measures, not opinion: how can you as an engineer put some credible background to the statement that one is better than the other?

§  Effect on other systems

·         Not just neighbor components

o   Packaging/Integration Engineer

o   Design Methodology

§  Single use component is wasteful (not maximizing its potential – good starting point in terms of mass reduction), however…

§  What is the prime motivation?

·         Mass (may not be acceptable for that component to do more than one job), materials, cost, service/repair

§  Watch for overcomplicated design

§  Don’t just think in 3 axes: there are an infinite number of axes

o   Mass: the engineer’s enemy

§  Accurate BOM is key

§  Use appropriate material, not just lightest

§  Accurate mass properties – don’t assume

§  Watch for items which do not appear on CAD

·         Fluids, paint, adhesives, sealant, weld beads/solder

§  Watch for items which should appear on CAD and sometimes do not!

·         Fasteners, pins, dowels, washers, seals/gaskets/o-rings, electrical wiring

o   Advanced engineering doesn’t mean advanced materials, it means properly diligent engineering

·         Occupant Safety

o   What are the primary methods of providing occupant safety?

o   Primary safety = prevention of incident

§  Driver visibility

·         Forward vision, lateral and vertical

·         Lateral vision: peripheral

·         Rearward vision: mirrors

§  Vehicle visibility to other vehicles

·         Lighting

§  Driver comfort

·         Ergonomics

§  Robustness of primary systems

·         Handling – road holding

·         Brakes system robustness

·         Steering system

o   Precision

o   Robustness

·         Suspension system robustness

·         Powertrain: delivering torque when requested

o   Secondary safety = occupant protection in crash event

§  Main structure purpose

·         Support driver under normal movement

o   Formula race car technique is to mold seat around driver in CFRP

o   Thin, rigid, light

o   Needs to be validated in vehicle tests under dynamic conditions

§  Small pieces of foam for extra rubbing protection

§  Foam is heavy

·         Support driver and seat in crash

o   Harness type

§  Comfort and support

o   Harness mounting

§  Load evenly distributed into main structure

o   Seat mounting

§  Separate seat belt mount location and seat mount location

o   à Harness mount and seat mount in different locations

·         Protect driver from intrusion in crash

o   Intrusion of external debris

o   Intrusion of outboard components of vehicle, e.g. wishbones

o   Intrusion of elements of main structure

·         Absorb energy in crash event

o   Crushable structure

·         Crash Analysis

o   Fundamental element of base vehicle structural design

§  Static/steady state loads

§  Shock loads

§  Crash loads

§  Harness/seat belt loads on structure

o   Conflict with mass

o   Crash protection

§  Intrusion: Protection cell, Strong, Stiff, Non-crushable, Zero intrusion

§  G-pulse: Compliant, Deformable, Crushable, 40G threshold for occupant

o   Front, side, rear, roof crashes

·         OEM Crash Tests

o   Front crash: Most difficult for G-pulse

§  Asymmetric loads

§  X\&Y direction G-pulse

§  Difficult to use crush structure

o   Side crash: Most difficult for intrusion

§  Lack of package space to absorb energy

o   Roof crash: Most difficult for driver visibility

§  Side of A-post and B-post

·         Occupant Safety

·         HV Battery and Powertrain safety: power unit packaging – in-line motor

·         Ergonomics/Driver Comfort

o   Driver as a component: conditions for efficiency

o   Driver ergonomics

o   Visibility lines

o   Pressure points: unnatural/unfamiliar posture

o   Thermal protection: ambient, local, radiation, cabin air-flow (effect of vehicle drag)

o   Robust structure

o   Quality actuation in dynamic systems: steering, suspension, pedal, and controls

o   Anything that adds to concentration loads: driver must be able to concentrate on efficient driving
