Quotations below for marketing purposes in the future. 

"Our visit to Williams was a truly unique and memorable experience. It encompassed many elements of what makes solar car such a worthwhile pursuit: the level of engineering, innovative thinking, passion, dedication, and drive, to name a few. 

The workshops were insightful and inspiring, with a good blend of fascinating F1 engineering and discussion applied to our applications. The engineers we engaged with were not only very knowledgeable about their respective fields, but also genuinely helpful when it came to the engineering challenges that we're tackling. 

I'm immensely grateful for having had this opportunity. This trip was truly one-of-a-kind, and served as an inspiring reminder of why we do the things that we do." 

-- Anna Olson

"The Stanford Solar Car Project was incredibly fortunate to visit Williams and consult with talented engineers. Between the technical presentations, facilities tours, and brainstorming sessions, SSCP is better prepared to tackle the extreme performance and efficiency goals required by solar car racing." 

-- Max Praglin

 

"The Williams visit was an excellent opportunity to learn from a professional race team.

Williams’s personnel were very helpful in showing us similarities between our car and Williams applications. We leaned especially much in the areas of aerodynamics and composites, and are eager to apply this new knowledge to our car.

We are thankful for our new relationship with Williams and look forward to the new knowledge and interactions that lie ahead." 

-- Darren Chen
