# SSCP - Sunwhale Aero Body Composite Design Review

# Sunwhale Aero Body Composite Design Review

We held a design review of the preliminary aero body composite design at meeting on Saturday, February 14. The presentation that was presented that day is attached to this page. A summary of alumni and team suggestions:

Top Shell:

* Uni tape x-pattern is overkill: use 2 longitudinal strips mirroring those on the bottomshell (transfer suspension loads) and that should be fine
* Cheeseholes: likely impractical and not very effective without a removable topshell (need to test)
* Make sure there are 3 extra plies for cutting/reinforcement around the rim of the layup and around the door

Bottom Shell:

* Kevlar likely not worth it to protect bottom of fairings: use extremely thin titanium sheetmetalBonding titanium to carbon: different CTE's (carbon's is negative) so cannot bond in mold (need to put a dummy piece in the mold to make indent and then do bonding after the layup)Structural section likely thicker than it needs to be: 4 layers plus core is okay

Access Panels:

* Bond area on Skybolt fasteners is extremely small: liable to break during bolting and unbolting (each one can take about 100lb shear with DP420)Need extra locating pins to actually bear the loadsAlternative: Ducati latches on long sideTen layers total in areas with fasteners

Other general notes:

* Rule of thumb: 3 sacrificial plies for cuttingUse plenty of release film on the door/access panel seams: rather have extra room than have to sand a month to take off a millimeter of carbonNeed to start practice making seams (see page on seam suggestions)

These suggestions were taken into account to come up with the more detailed ply map that appears on the Composites page.
