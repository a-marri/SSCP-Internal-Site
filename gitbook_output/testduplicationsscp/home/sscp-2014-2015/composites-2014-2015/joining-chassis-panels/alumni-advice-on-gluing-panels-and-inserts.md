# Alumni Advice on Gluing Panels and Inserts

From Adem:

I'm assuming you're using DP-460NS or some other similar epoxy.  I've regularly seen DP-460 exceed the core bond strength during coupon testing.  As far as you're concerned, it's basically a forever glue in this application.  So don't screw it up!  Be very careful to mask off any areas that you don't want to get glue slopped onto, because once it cures, it's never coming off.  Also be careful *not* to mask off areas you *do* want glue on.  Don't laugh, I've almost fucked this up before.

At UMN, we've always been very careful to mask off the region around where we're going to be gluing, in order to get nice crisp edges on our glue fillets that don't look like shit.  Examples: Masking on the Centaurus 2 chassis, C2 battery box, and Centaurus topshell.  Do the fillets nice and clean.  DP-460NS has a 60 minute worklife; you have plenty of time to get it right.  Remember to remove the masking tape after you've finished forming the fillets, but *before* the glue cures!  It's much harder to remove when it's covered in cured epoxy.

Be equally careful when gluing on the hardpoint inserts.  Just like with the panels, we did a masking setup for all of our TYE grommets.  Here's an example masking setup picture from the Centaurus rollcage mounts.  Note absolutely no glue slop around the inserts.  Steps:  1) mask over the area the holes.  2) cut a small hole and pop the inserts in dry. 3) Carefully cut the masking tape around the edges of the insert with an exacto knife.  4) Remove the insert and remove the circle of tape that you cut out.  5) Glue in the inserts. 6) REMOVE THE MASKING TAPE BEFORE THE GLUE CURES.  You don't want fragments to tape stuck under cured epoxy.

Be extremely careful to fully compresses your inserts when you install them.  Don't fail like UMN did with C3's front suspension (pic1, pic2). If I hadn't caught this major fail while randomly dropping into the shop, the suspension would have surely failed catastrophically.

I want to see you guys glue a clean chassis with no slop.  Don't fail like Northwestern did (they proudly posted high-res pics of this shit on their blog like it wasn't an embarrassing piece of most sloppy workmanship).

NHS expressed doubt about the go-to-space-worthiness of step 3 of my insert masking notes, so for his sake, I'd clarify: be careful, certainly don't cut into your chassis panels.  Trimming the tape should only require a very, very light touch.

Masking the inserts is certainly optional if you're worried about scoring the panels.  Just make sure to be diligent about cleaning up the epoxy that's squeezed out when the inserts are pressed together, and be careful not to get it on the outer faces of the inserts when cleaning up.  

On Capping Core

Remember to press peel ply onto the exposed epoxy before it cures. Then wipe over the peel ply with a squeegee to squeeze excess epoxy out making a nice flat surface. The peel ply gives the epoxy the same matte texture as the rest of your composites. As the epoxy starts to harden I would peel the peel ply off and then cut off any excess blobs of epoxy with a razor blade. There will be blobs that squeezed out when you ran the squeegee over the peel ply. There is a short window of time where the epoxy is soft enough to cut with a razor blade but cured well enough that peeling the peel ply off doesn't rip the epoxy out of the core.
