Composites Design Review Feb 14th 2015

Feedback:&#x20;

* Unidirectional weave on top shell seems unnecessary. Could save 2-3 kg of weight by removing them.&#x20;
* Cheeseholing top shell for array cooling and weight-savings. Williams Advanced Engineering composites engineer recommends leaving empty sections where we hope to cut top shell instead of laying up entire top shell and then cutting out sections after. What are the quantitative benefits of cheeseholing top shell of array? After further analysis, it seems like cheese-holing is not worthwhile for us to do, since we don't have a topshell. For reinforcing bottoms of fairings against beaching, extra composites won't help on the bottom (try thin titanium sheet), but would likely help on the filleted edges. Panel fastening issues!Quarter-turns we bought from Skybolt are very strong (how strong?) but don't have much gluing area. How will these attach strongly to the fairing?In what order will the quarter-turns be attached and removed? Do worst case analysis to figure out how few studs are necessary to hold the big fairing up.

Also see attached discussion about about using Swift's autoclave in Los Angeles.

Hey Everyone,

When Reid from Michigan was here the other night, I talked to him for a little while about their composites process, and they do their prepreg layups at their shop and then trailer their molds to Roush to cure the layup in their autoclave. I guess I had never really considered doing layups and cure in different places, but looking at their approach, it seems we could both solve the problem of building an oven and improve the quality of our layups if we could find a sponsor in the area who would let us use an autoclave.

Has anyone in the past looked into this?

Is there any reason this would be a bad idea?

I looked pretty seriously into ways to do bakes without building ovens. Lockheed and Loral SS both have autoclaves, and Lockhood was even willing to let us use theirs for free. Unfortunately, what they weren't willing to do was let us waltz in on our own schedule. They have classified stuff going through their process flow all the time, and the windows where we could come in and do a bake without seeing anything we weren't supposed to was infrequent and hard to schedule.

Boeing has several autoclaves up in Washington, but that's too far to be convenient. Also I never got further than, "yeah we might be willing to let you use those" with them. NASA AMES has a few, but they're trying really hard to commercialize AMES to avoid bankruptcy so they were expensive to use. They're also too small for a full car. We could do fairings in them. Their bigger hardware is at JPL, as far as I was led to believe.

There are a couple of heat treating places that would let us bake, but they were on order of $5k per run. On the bright side there are plenty of heat treatment ovens in the Bay Area. The down side is they're not really any better than the oven you'd build yourself, and considerably more expensive from a program perspective.

Something we almost did was get a shipping container and insulate it and call it an oven. Then Stanford got unhappy with using the land. Nevermind that they have all kinds of useless crap sitting around all over the place - including shipping containers. I liked the shipping container approach because it was multi-purpose (oven during layup season, race materials storage otherwise).

If you really want an autoclave, your best bet is probably to find one on the used heavy equipment market and try to buy it with an educational discount and/or tax writeoff for the seller. Unfortunately it'll probably give the facilities folks a hernia when you ask to plug it in, the land usage folks an aneurysm when you ask to put it somewhere, and the risk management folks an ulcer when you tell them it's a high-temperature pressure vessel that you want to let undergrads use. May the force be with you.

Personally I'm in favor of either doing the same that we've always done - prepreg layups under 1atm vacuum - or trying resin infusion with a closed cell core.

One avenue that may be worth exploring is to see if there are any custom boat or aircraft builders in the area. You can also see if you can fit some stuff into Finishline's autoclaves.

These guys are about 90 minutes south of my parents' place. I'll be in the area starting August 21 if anybody has a good reason for me to show up in person.

So, i think the people that have pitched in thus far have exhausted the basic things i have to say -&#x20;

Wayyy back when, I looked into find an autoclave for team use, and called upon all my contacts and name dropped SSCP all over the place to no benefit, for the multitude of reasons already mentioned.&#x20;

I think energy should be spent potentially rethinking the material choice in general, rather than relying on old habits such as prepreg. If anything, its a good exercise and learning experience to go back to the drawing board and start fresh, and the prepreg method may come out on top again, who knows. A lot of my reading these past couple years has been showing trends to out-of-autoclave processes.

Disclaimer - Following is how I understand things - do correct me if I'm off on something, cause I'm still learning about the wondrous material that is composites. I'm doing this most from memory, as I have none of my composites books to reference atm...thus mistakes are a possibility...

So, goals pertaining to SC - Weight minimized, strength and stiffness maximized, at least regards to our general structure in question. There are definite parts of the car we want to fail when a certain stress is exceeded (thus strength set to a certain limit given a certain laminate design), yet im not even going to light a firework near that hornets nest...for another day perhaps

Lets talk weight - for a given fiber, matched with a certain resin system(making sure sizing is compatible, etc), there is an optimum resin to fiber volume fraction to maximize strength for that lamina, and by doing so also making it the most weight efficient lamina. One of the main goals of the composites fabrication process is to achieve this volume fraction. This goal is hard to reach, as mold geometry, rate and degree of cure, laminate design, curing method, bagging setup, vacuum levels, etc, all need to just right for things to work. If they dont, you either have too much or too little resin, strength is lost, likely with a penalty of weight as well due to resin pooling in our usually soso bagging.

So on this note, if you want an enjoyable and top of the line read on curing of composites, you read this book. You will learn lots of things that are counter to most common, and wrong, knowledge. The prof who wrote it still has an office in Durand, and is somewhat easy to talk to. (I've always walked away a bit stressed after our talks, yet my questions were always answered)

[this book](http://www.amazon.com/Smart-Autoclave-Composites-Peter-Ciriscioli/dp/0877628025)

Also the intro in this random paper covers the basics of fiber volume fraction concerns well enough.

[this random paper](http://www.academia.edu/2041951/Determining_the_minimum_critical_and_maximum_fibre_content_for_twisted_yarn_reinforced_plant_fibre_composites)

So, as a possible plan of action: research fiber and matrix pairs that will provide the minimum mass and the appropriate strength and stiffness. There is no reason the car has to be made of one fiber matrix pair (other than simplicity perhaps) but hybridizing fibers tends to have benefits, and matching certain fiber/matrix pairs for certain uses (crumple cone vs chassis beam) could lead to far safer car.&#x20;

Now lets talk strength for a second. The strength of composites is greatly due to the quality of the laminate, aka to what degree does it have defects of any form, be they water vapor inclusions, air bubbles, off gassed volitiles, dust, oils, fiber wrinkles, resin rich or dry regions, degree of cure, correct post cure, (aka general condition of the microstructure of the matrix) so on and so forth. (composites have way too many things that can easily go wrong with them) Again, given our bagging and baking techniques, things are not going to be optimal.

Thus general thoughts -&#x20;

I do not claim to know how to exactly choose materials, though I have some idea of the process, we can chat about it if ya want. I also know that the team is usually restricted to that which is given to them for free. Given this is likely going to be the real driving factor, I say test, TEST, and test again. Given that the material is likely old, and our bag has leaks, and the temperature isnt even, etc, test coupons need to be made via the planned final process and tested to failure to determine the real materials properties based on our fabrication abilities. DO NOT rely on the supplied materials properties - they are based on very strict test procedures for tiny coupons, and dont reflect the guaranteed different properties we will achieve from our molds. Either get to know the folks in the Structures and Composites Lab (SACL) in the basement of durand, and have them teach you how to use their MTS machine, talk with the prof of SACL , prof Fu-Kuo Chang, take Drew Nelsons ME348 experiemental stress analysis which one of the labs is exactly the testing you need to do, or talk with the civil eng department, they have many large MTS machines in the building east of 550. You should do lots of tests, because you are going to get a huge spread of data. Composites are just not nice like that. From the statistically relevant data, you can now design a car with a tiny bit more peace of mind.

DO NOT ATTEMPT TO MODEL DAMAGE - IT IS A WASTE OF TIME. I have done two simple projects, a composite tube and double web I beam, and just the linear elastic region is hard to get data to correlate between simulation, hand calculations, and experimental data.... (meaning my percent difference was about 10 AT BEST, for the super simple tube experiment. the i beam was a factor of two off i think...)

Anyhow, thats my ramble. Srry for the poor english, im lazy sometimes. I've got lots of free time up here in Montana right now, so if ya want to chat, don't think twice about bothering me,
