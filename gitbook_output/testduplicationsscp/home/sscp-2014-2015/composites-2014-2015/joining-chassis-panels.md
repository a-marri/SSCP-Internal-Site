# Joining Chassis Panels

How do we structurally join 5/8" gauge carbon-aluminum honeycomb-carbon panels?

Manufacturers to Contact:

ACP Composites

M.C. Gill (don't call, I got this one)

Teklam

Hexcel

Ideas for how to contact:

"Hi, my name is __. I'm a Business Team Member with the Stanford Solar Car Project and I wanted to ask you about ways to structurally join aluminum sandwich panels. Our team has 5/8" gauge panels that we want to structurally bond together so as to make them longer. Do you have any products that might do this, or any suggestions on how to go about this?"

For Hexcel, you can even reference their own PDF.

10/24/14: Left a message with Justin Sparr at ACP Composites

10/24/14: Left a message at the engineering department of Teklam (sales representative sent my call there)

10/24/14: Called Hexcel and spoke to a receptionist named Lisa, and left information about our needs. She will call back with information.

                    -She called back, and left the name Ameet Kapadia, phone number (925) 520-4165, who is a sales engineer.

                    -I called Ameet and left a message. His cell phone, (714) 925-9797, was given in his voicemail, so I will call that.

                    -Ameet responded to his cell phone, and he said he doesn't have the specific information needed, and will call me back with the phone number of someone else who should be able to help.

10/27/14: I called Ameet back and he gave me the contact information for Justin Hamilton, phone number (317) 571-4081, who should have the desired information.

                    -The number given for Justin is a wrong number... called Ameet back and he doesn't know why. I was given Justin's email: justin.hamilton@hexcel.com and sent him an email.

10/27/14: I called Teklam and ACP again, and was sent to message machines again for both.

10/30/14: Called Ameet again, left a message.

10:31/14: Still no response. I called Hexcel and spoke to Lisa again. She didn't have anyone else to send me to, and gave me Ameet's email. She gave the same number for Justin, too.

                    -I sent Ameet an email. I'm not sure what else to do besides wait for a response from either Ameet or Justin through email.

                    -Ameet responded quickly saying that he sent a note to Justin. Now waiting just for a response from Justin.
