# SSCP - On-car IV Curves

# On-car IV Curves

Update 8/28/15: We used Shellpower to account for the different insolations; I had previously derped by only measuring the insolation from the ground instead of from each module (the car is curved, so it's different). I put a summary of results in the excel file (Arctan_testing_shellpower_result); I also made IV curves of each string using the attached matlab script, and tried to make the matlab script as adaptable as I could. The string IV curves are attached in a zip file; after looking at them, we decided that we didn't need to make any changes to the car for now. - John

IV Curves taken on 8/13/15 with the Keithley 2430; there were some problems with insolation readings, which resulted in some inaccuracies. The zip file contains the csv files. Overall, looks ok but currently doing more work on it to see what I can come up with after adjusting for insolation - John
