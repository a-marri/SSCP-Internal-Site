# SSCP - Array Testing

# Array Testing

Hey Matthew,

Here are the results from the first round of testing. I only had time to test one laminated cell and one bare cell, but I took three measurements per angle and averaged them to get the results in the excel sheet. I'm not sure that averaging is the best way to take the measurements, though, so let me know if you want me to do that a bit different. If you want the full data, it's all on the second sheet of the file (Pmax is efficiency, btw). 

I got a lot quicker with the testing toward the end, so I'll try to measure 2 more laminated cells and bare cells tomorrow. Do you want me to get both rotations for each laminated cell? Also, on a more random note, I can't figure out how to get the bare solar cells off of the jig without breaking them; do you have any advice on that?

Thanks,

John

Hey Matthew, 

I got the second round of testing done last week; here are the results! Sorry I didn't get them in earlier, I thought I'd be able to do some more testing and give you all the results at the same time, but work's been going pretty late recently so finding time to test has been tough.

Thanks,

John
