## SSCP - Concentrators

## Concentrators

Motivation

We want to obtain concentrated solar modules for Sunwhale. Potential companies for sponsorships and other relevant information here.

Notes

2014-09-20 (Charlie): We're trying to move forward with Arzon.

Arzon Solar - CONFIRMED, AWAITING DRAWINGS

Notes from call with Adam:

* Make new member project to figure out the direction of the sun
* &#x20;and properly aim the concentrators
* Earliest date to procure is November, 2014.
* Get DNI, tempereature, some aerosol optical depth, wind speed, humidity information to&#x20;
* get an estimate of what to expect in generation.&#x20;
* TMY databse is one option for spectral and solar condition data for a certain part&#x20;
* the planet.&#x20;
* 30 C3MJ Spectral Labs solar cell in series for smaller element. VOC is 3V
* 1m^2 sheet of plastic with lenses printed on it. The plate is 108V, 240W, 2.2A
* 5mm by 5mm solar cell, or 5.5 by 5.5

30 C3MJ Spectral Labs solar cell in series for smaller element. VOC is 3V

1m^2 sheet of plastic with lenses printed on it. The plate is 108V, 240W, 2.2A

5mm by 5mm solar cell, or 5.5 by 5.5

·      Two components: array and lens

·      Pin hole tracking (one hole to allow sun to align with lower dot)

·      DNI information for Australia to understand power output in morning and late afternoon (TMY Database)

o   Can generate performance with temperature, DNI, measurement of optical depth, (wind speed, humidity)

·      Sharper curve with concentrator at beginning and end of day

·      Will be able to provide concentrators at soonest November

·      Is there an electrical connection on plate

o   Yes, the cells will be connected in series

o   For smaller design, 30 c3mj+ spectrolab solar cells

o   IV curves on the website (put in circuit model, and figure out the IV curve of a plate)

o   OCV- 3V, current at high as 3 amps

·      Is the lens one large piece or a series of smaller lenses

o   Meter squared is a sheet of plastic with lens printed on

·      Active Cooling?

o   Cells have small aluminum heat sink behind

o   Newer design has all heat sinking on plate (as long as you take plate as given)

·      Plate is about an inch, inch and a half

·      Plate is possible to split; can be cut down to one; can cut of one row, one column etc

o   Question of where that happens in air

·      Can also wire the plate differently (completely in series)

o   If better to be half voltage and twice current, can make it happen

·      In newer design the cell is 5mm by 5mm (or 5.5 by 5.5)

Semprius - NO GO

2014-08-22:

At this point, we would only be interested in selling modules for commercial or utility-scale applications – for example, if the University were interested in installing solar on campus. We are not selling individual or small volumes of modules other than to our commercial partners for demonstration and market seeding purposes. Please advise on the quantity and application for the modules, and we can engage in further discussions.

Best,

Russ

Hello,

Thank you for your interest in Semprius. As you may be aware, Semprius holds the record for production solar module efficiency, reaching 35.5% percent. In addition, we were named to MIT Technology Review’s 2013 50 Disruptive Companies List, an annual list of the world’s most innovative technology companies. We have partnered with leading tracker providers to develop systems that are unparalleled in the industry. We have also joined with leading global technology companies like Siemens (an investor) and Aerojet Rocketdyne (a customer) to deliver our systems to the market.

[50 Disruptive Companies List](http://www2.technologyreview.com/tr50/2013/)

We are in the process of ramping up our production, but have already deployed systems to North Carolina, Alabama, Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico, Germany, Spain, France, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Qatar and China. We typically work with EPCs and project developers interested in using our systems for commercial and utility-scale ground-mounted projects. If you’d like to see a video of one of our systems in operation, check it out here – this system was installed at SolarTAC in Colorado last year with our partner Aerojet Rocketdyne.

Soitec - WAITING TO HEAR BACK

Based on the datasheet it looks like one CX-M500 "module" of this unit is 12 smaller rectangular units. One CX-S530 installation has 12 of the CX-M500 modules.

One module is 3.67 m x 2.39 m x 0.102 m in a 6 by 2 configuration of smaller rectangular units. This makes each rectangular unit:

Size: .6116m x 1.2m x. 102m

Power: 204W

Weight: 7.5KG

This seems very promising, though the rectangular unit is quite large. Here's what it looks like in the car: If we can trim some height it looks really good for between the wheels in the non-driver fairing.
