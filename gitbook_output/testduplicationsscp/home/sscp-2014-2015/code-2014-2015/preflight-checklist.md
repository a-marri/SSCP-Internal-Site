2. Sync to the latest SVN revision (both code and electrical)
3. Make sure the car is running the code you expect, usually the head revision of SVN.Make sure you have VPN access to Stanford (to access IAR license server just in case).

Buttons in manual drive

* Pressing cruise up (the right blue button on the steering wheel) turns on cruise control with the setpoint at the current speed.
* Pressing cruise down (the left blue button on the steering wheel) does nothing.
* Pressing reverse (the black button on the steering wheel) does nothing if the car is moving in either direction.
* Pressing reverse toggles the direction of acceleration. This remains toggled until the next time reverse is pressed or the next time the car is power cycled.

Pressing cruise up (the right blue button on the steering wheel) turns on cruise control with the setpoint at the current speed.

Pressing cruise down (the left blue button on the steering wheel) does nothing.

Pressing reverse (the black button on the steering wheel) does nothing if the car is moving in either direction.

Pressing reverse toggles the direction of acceleration. This remains toggled until the next time reverse is pressed or the next time the car is power cycled.

Cruise control

* Pressing cruise up (the left blue button on the steering wheel) increases the cruise speed by a set amountAmount is approximately 1 mphPressing cruise up in reverse does nothing
* Amount is approximately 1 mph
* Pressing cruise up in reverse does nothing
* Pressing cruise down (the right blue button on the steering wheel) decreases the cruise speed by a set amountAmount is approximately 1 mphDecreasing the cruise speed through zero breaks out of cruise (does not put the car in reverse)
* Amount is approximately 1 mph
* Decreasing the cruise speed through zero breaks out of cruise (does not put the car in reverse)
* Pressing reverse (the middle blue button on the steering wheel) does nothing if the car is moving in either direction.
* Depressing the brake pedal returns the car to manual drive.
* Pressing the accelerator pedal increases the speed of the car according to the position of the accelerator pedal, but does not change the cruise speed.Releasing the accelerator pedal therefore lets the car coast down to its cruise speed.
