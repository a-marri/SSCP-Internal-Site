Fundraising Guidelines for 2014-2015

In my talks with Brooke Groves-Anderson, Office of Development (the money/donations machine at Stanford), and Jeff Gordon, Associate Director of Corporate Relations, School of Engineering, I was told that for donations below $5000 or so it would not be necessary to talk to Brooke and Jeff for insight and approval. For donations whose value exceeds $5,000, in particular cash donations with a value in excess of that, it would be wise to talk to Jeff and Brooke to explain which company we are talking to, why, and what we are planning to offer in exchange for what we are expecting. 

Jeff and Brooke help the team ensure that we do not cross any lines when fundraising by promising publicity we cannot give, like anything that resembles an endorsement or promotion. They also help us connect a potential big sponsor to the University as a whole to see if any other student groups or research efforts could benefit from that similar support. 

Understand the details of the sponsorship brochure, which we have had approved as our primary basis for designing sponsorship opportunities. The language in it is tailored to offer companies and supporters just enough reward for their contribution without crossing the line as to what we can do. In general, when seeking sponsorships, you want to avoid promising endorsement or promotion, and you want to keep all negotiations informal so that no contract has to be signed, ideally. Most of our sponsorships operate with a verbal contract--an email or phone exchange, instead of a written one which the University's Industrial Contracts Office would have to sign on our behalf.

Advisory board fundraising policies may change from cycle to cycle. To begin talks with the University, use our historical sponsorships and their successes as a basis for reminding the Board of the historical policies and exceptions we have been allowed to follow.

The sponsorship document linked above lists our sponsors and details how these are arranged and renewed.  

This page contains the 2014-2015 sponsorship brochure and other outreach documents, as well as several files relevant to specific, large sponsors.
