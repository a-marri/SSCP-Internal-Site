Email Thread:

TO ANDREW FROM KELSEY

Hi Andrew,

My name is Kelsey Josund and I'm on the Stanford Solar Car Business Team. I got your contact information from Guillermo and am contacting you to ask about ways our team can rent Volkswagen cars directly from Volkswagen Australia or an affiliated dealership.

We're seeking support vehicles for the team to use during the World Solar Challenge in Australia next fall. As you explained to Guillermo, We understand that Volkswagen can no longer donate cars for us to use for this cycle as was the case in 2013. We were wondering about potentially arranging direct rentals from Volkswagen Australia. It would be great if you could help us figure out how best to get access to the cars we need while maintaining our exclusive arrangement with Volkswagen. 

Preferably, we'd have a Tiguan to serve as a chase vehicle, a Jetta AS A scout and another Jetta for THE LEAD SUPPORT VEHICLE. We'd want these vehicles to be diesel-powered, ideally.

We would appreciate your help in looking for Volkswagen vehicles for us to rent in Australia.

Thanks so much for your help!

TO KELSEY FROM ANDREW

Hey Kelsey,

 

I apologize for the late response. Thanks for reaching out.

 

I’ve been asking around here to see if there’s another method for you to get a hold of support vehicles in Australia. Unfortunately, I have yet to find an alternate to purchasing or leasing a vehicle (both of which I imagine would be unsuitable for SSCP). It may be worth taking a look to see if there are rental car companies that would work out.

 

I will let you know if I find any other news.

 

Regards,

Andrew Chang

Hey,

Thanks for getting back, even if it did take a few days!  I appreciate you looking into it. We wanted to clarify though, will we be required to rent Volkswagen vehicles as part of your sponsorship? Obviously we will try to but with budgetary constraints it may be significantly cheaper to use another brand, and it would also give us more options as we look for cars to rent.

Thanks,

Kelsey Josund

TO KELSEY FROM ANDREW

Hey Kelsey,

 

There is not a requirement, but we would very much appreciate if you could find a Volkswagen support vehicle.  I had a few minutes and I found this website, but I have no idea how reputable it is (http://australia.rentalcars24h.com/melbourne-airport/volkswagen). Perhaps it’s worth looking to see if there’s something similar that would be useful for the team.

Keep in mind that the sponsorship is coming from Volkswagen Group which actually encompasses many brands, any of which would be preferable to going outside the group’s vehicles (http://www.volkswagenag.com/content/vwcorp/content/en/brands_and_products.html). I know that Skoda has a presence in Australia as well. Ideally, we can avoid a situation where a Volkswagen sponsored race car is being towed by a Ford (or Holden as the case may be in Australia).

I’ve also sent a follow up to a public relations manager in Volkswagen Australia that we’ve been in contact with before, but he’s out on travel until the 24th. I’ll let you know if he comes back with any useful information.

 

Thanks,

Andrew Chang

This cycle, VW could not sponsor our team with Australian convoy vehicles. This page helps us document the rental car process.
