# Procuring Chassis Panels 2014-2015

This cycle, the team was unable to secure any special discounts or sponsorship from M.C. Gill and Teklam corporation, who both manufacture carbon-backed aluminum honeycomb sandwich panels. There were some fiberglass and Nomex panels available at discounted rates, but the aluminum-carbon panel manufacturing processes have improved enough to eliminate the waste we were familiar with in 2011-2012. M.C. Gill and Teklam also did not have 12' panels in stock, as these are always made for large, custom orders. Our order was not a large one, and the negotiation process showed that we were not the primary customer. 

The team has enough panels to make another car and more (esp. a thin car like Sunwhale), but we don't have any 12 foot panels. Darren's chassis designs have lead the team to believe that there is significant advantage in strength, manufacturability, and simplicity of deisng to using 12 foot panels as opposed to 8 foot panels for certain chassis members. 

The premise is simple: Our team wants 5/8" gauge, carbon-backed aluminum honeycomb panels in 12 foot length. This is very difficult to accomplish. 

Challenges faced:

* M. C. Gill requires a minimum order quantity of 8 panels, and all have to be 12 feet long if even one panel is. This brings our cost to about $10.5k, just so we can obtain 12 foot 5/8" gauge panels. In my quote request, I mixed in other gauges to make sure we have a variety around. Teklam also requires a minimum order for carbon-backed panels. The cost of the carbon alone is $5-10k, plus the cost of the panels. ACP Composites and Hexcel do not manufacture the type of panels we need. M.C. Gill makes the best panels of the kind we're looking for.

Update

Panel order placed via email on Oct 31, 2014. Have not yet received confirmation or sent payment. 

Conclusion

Panel order paid for in part ($6000/$10700) on November 24, 2014, ending over two months of back-and-forward email and phone conversation conversation. We could not buy 4x12' panels easily in the gauges we need. Finally, M.C. Gill agreed to allow us to purchase two different gauges (5/8" and 3/8") of 4x12' panels at a reasonable price ($1200-$1340 per panel). We were forced to purchase a minimum quantity of 8, and no sponsorship or discount was available. Teklam also wanted a custom order for around $15,000 if we wanted to buy 12' panels. For questions regarding why we demanded 12' panels, please reference the chassis design. Could we have overlapped 8' panels that we have so many of?

To account for the massive material inflow and large cost borne by purchasing these 12' panels, I will try to sell our team's old 8' panels to other solar car teams like USC, Cal, and the Bend, OR high school team. All have been contacted and are tentative. We cannot keep this many panels above the kitchen ceiling; also, it would be nice to recuperate some of the expense that went into these materials. 

Attached are the final email conversations.
