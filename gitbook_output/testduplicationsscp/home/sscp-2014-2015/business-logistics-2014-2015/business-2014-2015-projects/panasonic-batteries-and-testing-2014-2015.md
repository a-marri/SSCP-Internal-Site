# SSCP - Panasonic Batteries and Testing 2014-2015

# Panasonic Batteries and Testing 2014-2015

No sponsorship from Panasonic as of 11/1/2014. Received word from Paul Dennig on Nov 6, 2014 that request is pending. 

No sponsorship at all, team will be required to pass a nail penetration (antipropagation) test. Requirements later amended to include design drawings and schematics, though I do not think we submitted these. 

Results/feedback from Japan is still pending as of Sept 1 2015. Likely will come next cycle. 

Test results are linked below. Key email conversations detail the process. 

Where to Test

Talk to previous team about this. 

Tips on Passing Test

>= 20 mm pitch (cell center-to-center spacing)

Mica or similar barrier between cells

Fire-resistant glass-filled nylon. 

Write-up to come later.
