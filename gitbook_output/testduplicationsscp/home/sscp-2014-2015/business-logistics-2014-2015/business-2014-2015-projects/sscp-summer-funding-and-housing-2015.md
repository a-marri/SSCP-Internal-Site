# SSCP - SSCP Summer Funding and Housing 2015

# SSCP Summer Funding and Housing 2015

This page talks about solar car SURI research stipends and other summer funding, as well as summer accommodations. 

 

For the SSCP 2015 summer house, the team cares about proximity to the shop, price, size, and availability. The place has to be close, cheap, big enough for ten people (two people can room together if the room sizes permit), and has to be available for us to rent for June 2015 to September 2015. 

When contacting landlords or property managers, make sure to let them know how serious you are. We want to secure this place as soon as possible. I contacted our old landlord months ago and found that our house would be occupied during the summer of 2015. The old solar car house was at 1134 Madera Ave, Menlo Park. It was big and cheap, but could have been closer to the shop and is now no longer available. Here's the comparison info you'll need. 

For comparison, here's the message received from 1134 Madera Ave, Menlo Park landlord:
