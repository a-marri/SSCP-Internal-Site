## Procuring Fairing Tape

We want really good, high-temperature tape to attach our fairings to the car. This tape should:

-Have excellent thermal properties

-Be at least 1 inch wide

-Be as clear as possible

-Be readily available in quantities of 15+ rolls

-Be available through sponsorship, or not too expensive

Here's what worked well for the team in 2013:
