# SSCP - Outsourcing Machining 2014-2015

# Outsourcing Machining 2014-2015

A critical change for the 2014-2015 cycle. A majority of complex parts were outsources to Stratasys in Michigan, Gonsels in Oakland, Proto Labs in Minnesota, and GS Model in Shenzhen. 

Guillermo's Reasons to Outsource

* Meeting deadlinesPreserving academic integrity of all team members. This is critical to the survival of the team. People cannot fail their classes because they are machining nonstop. Cheap--with sponsorship and anticipated budgeting, machining outsourcing saved the team time and money. Access to expertise, tooling, and materials. We gained acccess to large blocks of 7075-T651 throught Stratasys, but never could do this on our own before.

Thoughts on Machining/Watch out For

* GS Model of Shenzhen has superior quality, good tolerances, great surface finish and attention to detail. Great, unbeatable Chinese prices (for now, the year 2015). Overall our contact Gemma was very pleasant to interact with and responded immediately. The team's in-house machining skill must be preserved. Make parts in house that are best made in-house. Parts to make in house include:All hardpoints (suspension and otherwise)HeadlightsA-arms, steering arms if applicableSeatbelt mountsEtcTake care of the CNC and continue our agreement with PRL/Craig Milroy for machine maintenance. Maintain a great relationship with Jim Gonsalves and co. of Gonsel's machining. They are great for advice, very tightly-toleranced parts.
