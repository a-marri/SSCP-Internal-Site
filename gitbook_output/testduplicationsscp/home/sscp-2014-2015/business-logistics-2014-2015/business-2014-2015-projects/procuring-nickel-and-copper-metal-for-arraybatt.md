# SSCP - Procuring Nickel and Copper Metal for Array/Batt

# Procuring Nickel and Copper Metal for Array/Batt

Battery Needs

1800-2000 square inches of 0.010" nickel metal (Ni 200/201) for electrical uses. Talk to Emily Henriksson about any details on the battery needs. Research nickel-plated aluminum and ways to solder these tabs to batteries. If that doesn't work, we'll go for nickel again.

Emily's Email for questions about area required: emilyh7@stanford.edu

Look into places to do resistance welding. Ideally we'd want to have access to a resistance welder. Can we borrow or rent one?

Questions about welding: Ask Ian Girard, igirard101@gmail.com and Max Praglin, mpraglin@stanford.edu

Array Needs

Need Italix metal tabs etched. Italix also provides the metal. Talk to Matthew Matera about estimating area for array metal tabs. Have him confirm the CAD model, since there's an incorrect design out there. 

Tabs use tin-plated copper from Italix etching. See attached dxf format drawing for tabs.
