As of August 25, 2014, the Hazell House is booked from October 08-18, 2015.

The above spreadsheet is what resulted from an exhaustive search of furnished accommodations to house possibly 20 people for 2+ weeks before the race starts on October 15th, 2015. Major considerations: cost, number of beds, number of bathrooms, proximity to the Darwin track, swag factor, and parking.

Summary:

* The Hazell House (top row) has the advantage of being cheap, furnished (with enough beds for 16 people), and on ground level (plus parking for trailer).
* Apartments can fit all of us, provided that we rent a couple of them, but they are usually up high and away from all the parking.
* A hostel is probably preferable to an apartment in terms of practicality, but apartments are significantly more comfortable.
