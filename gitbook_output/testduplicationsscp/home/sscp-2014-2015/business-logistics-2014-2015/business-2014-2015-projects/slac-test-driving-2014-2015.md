# SLAC Test Driving 2014-2015

Hello Adele,

We currently have an agreement in place through the end of this fiscal year that covers this, so there is no problem with scheduling time to test the vehicle along the Linac Access Road.  The agreement is attached so you have a record of it.

When you are ready to do the testing, please contact Simon Ovrahim, SLAC Security Manager (cc’ed) to coordinate the best time, access, and any support you might need.

Looking forward to working with you.

Best regards

Brian

UPDATE: SLAC Test Road is a very bad road to test on. There are too many potholes and roaming wildlife. Do no pursue in the future.
