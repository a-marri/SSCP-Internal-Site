WARNING WARNING WARNING

"Australia’s unique environment and important agricultural industries are free from many pests and diseases found in other parts of the world - but the movement of personal effects is one way these could be introduced. For example, outdoor furniture could harbour timber pests or be contaminated with soil or exotic weed seeds, while animal products such as meat, eggs, milk or cheese could contain diseases that could be transmitted to humans and other animals. AQIS - the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service - works to protect Australia’s natural and economic assets from these risks while facilitating the international movement of people and goods."

This means: Clean everything that the team ships. Do not ship used tarps if they cannot be cleaned well. Do not ship anything dirty with Central Valley dust if it cannot be cleaned well. Clean all tires, clean all personal equipment. Clean everything or Australia will quarantine items, reject or delay shipments, or potentially steam clean things that should not be steam cleaned without asking and then send you a bill for it.&#x20;
