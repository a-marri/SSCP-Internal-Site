# SSCP - Outsourcing and Export Control

# Outsourcing and Export Control

With great distaste, I looked into outsourcing certain services that the team cannot do well internally. We already outsource certain complex jobs like 5-axis machining. Here's the response we received from the University. 

Hi Stan, 

This is Guillermo from the Stanford Solar Car 

I wanted to ask if there are any restrictions relating to export control on collaborating with a .... [foreign firm from Pakistan].

We would be working with this company not through a sponsorship but through a paid consultancy. 

I would appreciate any feedback on the legality or danger of what I propose. If there are no restrictions, at least we''ll have looked fully into the matter. 

Thank you.

Hi, Guillermo;

 

I will need to refer this to the Export Control Officer for the University.  It’s great that you are asking.  I don’t know if this would be an issue, since we would be receiving technologies, not sending them, but it would probably be best to have Steve Eisner take a look at it before moving forward.

 

Thanks,

Stan,

Thanks for bring me into this.

Guillermo, I agree with Stan – it’s great that your sensitive to EC issues.

First, I can confirm that FarCFD is not on a US Restricted Party List for export control purposes.

Second, as long as FarCFD’s meshes generated for Stanford may be shared with anyone - i.e. the generated mesh is not proprietary to FarCFD and is Stanford’s property to be shared with whomever we wish, there shouldn’t be an issue.  There could be a “deemed” export issue if use of or access to FarCFD’s digital files releases FarCFD proprietary technology in the form of either source code or technical data.  Presumably they would have you sign an NDA if sharing the digital files would result in such a transfer, and I would doubt they anticipate a need for an NDA.

In the worst case scenario, even if they do need to share with you their proprietary and disclosure restricted technology/source code used to generate the mesh, such technology/source code would be released from export control once FarCFD agreed that the technology/source code could be released into the public domain i.e. made generally available to the public upon request. 

Hope this helps,

Steve Eisner
