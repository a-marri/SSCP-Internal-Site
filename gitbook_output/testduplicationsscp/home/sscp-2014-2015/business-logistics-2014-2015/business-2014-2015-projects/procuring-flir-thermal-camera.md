# SSCP - Procuring FLIR thermal camera

# Procuring FLIR thermal camera

We want a high quality thermal camera for heat testing of various types. The FLIR E4 or E5 cameras seem to be good options, so we are seeking a partnership with FLIR.

At this point we are waiting to hear back form one of their PR reps, Haley Ellison, about the sponsorship. If the sponsorship goes through, we will either get the camera as a donation, or borrow it free of charge (awaiting terms if we do borrow it).

If they donate the E5 (~$1,400), they will be a Friends level sponsor. If we borrow a camera, or they donate the E4 (~$850), we will work something out for a more limited sponsorship level.
