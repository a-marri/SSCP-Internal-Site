## Business Advice 2014-2015

Hi team,&#x20;

I want to send this email as a lesson to everyone and future teams about the importance of working well with well-chosen manufacturers and suppliers, and of being adaptable and aggressive in responding to delays and challenges.&#x20;

There are currently three manufacturers who are holding us back, for several reasons.&#x20;

* Keller Waterjet - They are very busy and were not able to waterjet our panels last week. We delayed sending out proper battery box files for about a week (not blaming, but this was the case), and when we did send them we left little cutting time for last week. They should _hopefully_ be done by Friday. Gonsel's Machine Shop - While they do great work, it's historically been late work. The grand total of 4 titanium spindles we sent out months ago are late by a month, and may or may not be ready by Friday. This machining work is free and good quality, but timing is not something we have much control over no matter how much time we give or how friendly our relationship is. Custom Vehicle Wraps - This shop is not late yet but I predict they may run out of time and we will have to pick up the car late Friday evening (that's only a few hours later than we wanted to pick up). The shop was late on an internal deadline of printing the vinyl, so that's why we haven't had a shop visit to go see the car's skin before its application starts.&#x20;

Other Manufacturers or Suppliers who had delays this cycle:

* Christensen Fiberglass Tooling - A serious mill accident lost us a week and a half at least and nearly entirely derailed Stanford Solar Car 2014-2015. Thankfully we received the first mold in time to start layups, and the second mold followed shortly after. There was an intense battle against time for the last few weeks of the deadline to make this all work. Alert Tubing - Tube benders and welders in Illinois. Delays on our part caused delays in manufacturing which pushed the company past the time they needed to finish our project. They moved on to more pressing work and then came back to our project. We received the roll cage a few weeks later than anticipated. Bell Plastics - Thermoformers for the bubble gave us a four for one deal for bubbles that we could not use. Their mold maker made a mold that had less buffer space than expected and our bubbles were repeatedly under-trimmed. We should be picking up a new bubble this week. Cytec - Manufacturer of some critical composites materials like film adhesive, surface master. They could not meet their initial lead time quote, and we had to quickly switch to a Texas-based reseller that had some smaller material quantities in stock. This delay would have also derailed Stanford Solar Car 2014-2015.

Challenges to Come:

Not to scare anyone, but there are lots of other delays that could come up:

* One of our ocean shippers could experience delays. Earlier this year there were major protests at the ports of Long Beach and LA. We need to make sure we can respond immediately to any challenge that comes up. There's also a list of manufacturer delays related to legal challenges, but that's another question. The battery procurement issue is ongoing, though we have a backup.&#x20;

The lesson here: No matter how well we do as a team of engineers, designers, business planners, etc. there are factors pretty much entirely out of our control. It is very important to cultivate good relationships with good suppliers, but as you can see even that is not enough to save us from delays and mistakes made by everyone.&#x20;

For future solar car team leads and sub-team leads: Take your people skills and make sure you start improving those now. Reduce your email response time to a tiny fraction of what it is now, and start learning how to make phone calls again, to any part of the US or the world necessary. Research industries and suppliers and understand the networks that exist between them and the fields they operate in. Pick up on some people and corporate politics and start navigating those relationships.&#x20;
