--> We're working on gathering a comprehensive repository of quality solar car photos. These will be useful for crafting presentations, media materials, use on the website, and more. 

Make sure to credit the original photographer when uploading photos, and try to find the high quality versions (not off of facebook). Sort into appropriate albums.
