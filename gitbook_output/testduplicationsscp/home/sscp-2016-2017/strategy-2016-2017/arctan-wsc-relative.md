These numbers give an idea of how we compared to other teams in WSC 2015 (more teams coming soon).

NUON

We finished 3.47 hrs behind Nuon

* 1.82 hrs due to Bin J + encapsulation and manufacturing lossesThis is based on 21.5% vs 24.1% encapsulated cell efficiencies for Arctan vs. Nuna 8 (Nuon had a Chusel array).0.26 hrs due to weight212 kg for Arctan vs. 150 kg for Nuna 8 (quoted on their website, so perhaps closer to 160 kg? Does anybody remember their scrutineering weigh in? If it’s actually 150 kg then this is more like 0.30 hrs)0.14 hrs due to electrical power drawBased on Nuon team-member quotes of around 20 W vs. our 31 W0.30 hrs due to speed limiting by our motorsAssuming no difference in rolling resistance losses (except as already accounted for by weight)That leaves ~0.95 hrs left due to AerodynamicsBased on numbers from the strategy simulation model, that is a difference of about 2.5 N of dragAKA, it appears that Nuna 8’s drag was around 33.5 NHOWEVER: This assumes linear power consumption. If we gained more power from the array, we would have driven faster and thus used more power by the motors via aerodynamic losses. A parallel result of this is that Aero likely accounts for a greater percentage of our difference from Nuon than these numbers represent (which may also mean that Nuna 8’s drag number was closer to 32 N).

Here’s where we stand in these areas (as of Oct 19, 2016): We will almost certainly eliminate the majority of the array power differences (an improvement that other teams won’t be able to match, short of obtaining Bin N cells which seems all but impossible), we believe that we have solved the speed limiting problem by increasing pack voltage, electrical power draw is being tackled now (we still need to figure out what’s up with the WiFi power consumption), and we will be reducing our weight somewhat, which will make a difference even if we don’t cut out the full 60-70 kg. Then there’s aero. I know the aero team has been working really hard, and it appears that we’re hitting our target number (29 N). The more performance we can eke out there the better, as that’s really the last frontier for significant improvements.
