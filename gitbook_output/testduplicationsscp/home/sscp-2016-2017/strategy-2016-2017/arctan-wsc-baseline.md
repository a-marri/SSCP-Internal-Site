Analysis of Arctan’s Race Performance

Notes

* There is some small uncertainty in the power-to-drive numbers. This is due to 2 things:1) The motor power data differs significantly between the Central Valley and Australia (likely due to increased side winds, and thus wheel scrubbing and rolling resistance).  As a result, only Australia data can be used to accurately characterize Arctan’s power-to-drive under race conditions. On average, Arctan’s power-to-drive in the Central Valley was ~200 W lower than in Australia.2) For much of the data recorded in Australia, when a polynomial (cubic) fit was generated the curve was ill-fitting and had a negative cubic coefficient (should be positive). This includes the race data. There was a small, yet reasonable amount of data for which a good fit could be generated, so I have used that (and the poorly-fitted race data) in the power-to-drive analysis.

Power

* Power To Drive:1.33 kW to drive at 23.77 m/s (Arctan average race cruise speed)  -  this is based on race data (avg of clean power vs. speed data sections)Polynomial (cubic) fit of race data is poor (negative x^3 coefficient), but suggests 1.35 kW. See Figure 1.1.30 kW to drive at 23.77 m/s  -  based on polynomial (cubic) fit of clean power-vs-speed data from 09.26.15 (cleanest Australia test data). See Figure 2.Conclusion: Because race data yields a poor fit, the fit from 09.26.15 can be used. However, that fit appears to be slightly lower than the measured average of the race data, and thus should be viewed as a lower bound for race performance. The average of the clean power vs. speed race data seems to be right on the mark, though it is not extendible beyond the power value corresponding to the average cruise speed. The result is a relatively small range (1.30-1.33 kW).

Other Notes on the Data

* ‘cell_v_13’ was consistently different from the voltage of the rest of the battery cells. It often took the extreme - if the battery was discharging, it would be lower, if the battery was charging, it would be higher) TODO: RMS delta from mean of remaining cells during charging and discharging.
