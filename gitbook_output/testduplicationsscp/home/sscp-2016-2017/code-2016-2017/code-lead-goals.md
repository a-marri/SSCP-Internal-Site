# Code lead goals

Manage the timeline.

Make and enforce the timeline. Ensure that the code is shippable. Unblock people by connecting them with the resources they need.

Maximize productivity by utilizing people effectively. Match peopleâ€™s skillsets and interests with the right project.

Use project management tools like Trello.

Ensure people are aware of progress and opportunities by sending weekly or monthly progress emails.

Grow the code team.

Recruit new members to ensure the transfer of knowledge.

New members require interesting projects. People are motivated when they feel that the project is interesting and have either the right skillset or the ability to acquire the right skillset.

It takes a lot of energy to bring people up to speed with embedded code. Create reusable documentation so it is easier for both parties.

Create a presentation on what the code team does, history of code team, faces of the code team.

Create guided tutorial projects. Highlight relevant places in the data sheet. Link to external resources on C, C style. - Also a good way to solidify knowledge.

Document the code, ask the author(s) for help. Use pull requests to request review from relevant people.

Think of future projects now so people can get started on them sooner.

Host social gatherings (code team dinners), day at the beach, hikes, hackathons, etc.

Inter-subteam design decisions.

Sync with EE team for lower power, more robust systems.

Steering wheel driver input.

A vastly redesigned electrical system.

Merge the code team + electrical team into the embedded team.

Start by teaching Altium to CS people and C to EE people.

A good opportunity to write documentation.

Code design decisions.

Redesign catalog.

Document while building.

Move to git.

Document while setting up.

Code reviews via pull requests.

Tests, and testing framework

Document while setting up.

Chase board (NRF, cloud camera, dash cam, wifi)
