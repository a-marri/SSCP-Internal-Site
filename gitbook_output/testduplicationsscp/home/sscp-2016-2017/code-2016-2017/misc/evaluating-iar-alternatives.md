We've used IAR for Arctan and Luminos. While it has worked okay, there have also been some frustrations:

1. Licensing restrictions. You either have to be connected to the internet, or have a license checked out. Additionally, we have a limited number of seats (7)

2. IAR works only on Windows. Most Stanford CS students are more familiar with a unix environment.
