# SSCP - New Member Set Up

# New Member Set Up

You need to be running Windows to use our development tools, so if you have a Mac or Linux figure out how to get Windows running.

Your options are VMWare Fusion (free from Stanford) or Boot Camp. Basically, it's either a virtual machine (easier to switch back and forth but slower to run) or a second computer in your computer (need to reboot to switch back and forth, but much faster when running).

Search for "VMWare" on https://stanford.onthehub.com/WebStore/Welcome.aspx and download the newest version available for your OS.

You should also be able to find Windows XP there to download, which you'll need for either a virtual machine or dual booting. We also have the SSCP dev VM on SFTP, which comes with the properly setup command line, IAR, and Altium, but is a little out of date.

Then, you'll need to clone the git repo (https://github.com/sscp/sundae-micro) which will require you to set up an ssh key (https://help.github.com/articles/generating-an-ssh-key/). Before you can do that you'll need to download Git for Windows (https://git-scm.com/download/win).

And now your dev environment is all ready!
