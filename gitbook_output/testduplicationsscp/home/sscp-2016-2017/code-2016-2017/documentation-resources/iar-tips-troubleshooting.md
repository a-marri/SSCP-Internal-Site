Tips

To make a copy of an existing project:

* Copy all project files to new folder.Remove workspace files from new folder (*.eww and ./settings/*.wsdt, NOT *.ewp.wsdt)Change all filenames in folder to new name (don't worry about things in "settings" folder).From IAR, create a new workspace (by exiting out of your current one), click project->add existing project, select the *.ewp file in the new project folder.Save workspace in new project folder.
* Copy all project files to new folder.

Copy all project files to new folder.

Remove workspace files from new folder (*.eww and ./settings/*.wsdt, NOT *.ewp.wsdt)

Change all filenames in folder to new name (don't worry about things in "settings" folder).

From IAR, create a new workspace (by exiting out of your current one), click project->add existing project, select the *.ewp file in the new project folder.

Save workspace in new project folder.

If your variables aren't showing up in watch:

The compiler is probably optimizing them out. Go to project options -> C/C++compiler -> Optimizations -> Turn optimizations off.

Packing structs:

IAR uses a different keyword for struct packing than GCC.

[keyword ](http://netstorage.iar.com/SuppDB/Public/SUPPORT/005609/Example%205.pdf)

(If you don't know what struct packing is, don't worry about this)

If your printfs aren't showing up:

Make sure you have \n at the end of the line.Â  It won't flush it out otherwise.

Common Fixes

Before running any projects, make sure that the following is configured or set up:

* Debugger ConfigurationsIn the file menu, right click on the project name and go to options.In the Debugger category:In the Setup tab, check that the Driver is set to ST-LINK.In the Download tab, check that the following elements are checked: "Verify Download" and "Use Flash Loader." Don't override the default .board file.

Common Errors

Error: Missing Files

* Try downloading the lib folder in addition to the project that you are working on. It will also probably be worth it to download all of the projects from software-micro.

Fatal Error: ST link, no MCU device

* Connection issue: try unplugging and replugging the cables. The problem might fix itself.
* You're working with two debugging sessions and the other did not close completely.
* Are you sure the connection isn't failing on other components of the car as well?
* The board itself might not working; try using a different board.
* Try reverting to a more recent copy of the code.
* Depending on the board you are using, you may have to change the interface from SWD to JTAG. Most of the boards in solar car use SWD, though:In the file menu, right click on the project name and go to options.In the ST-LINK category, change the interface from SWD to JTAG.
