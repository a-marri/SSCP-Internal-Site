# SSCP - CAN

# CAN

The Controller Area Network (CAN) protocol is an automotive information transfer protocol that dates to 1987. It is currently the industry standard, though some companies are shifting to Ethernet.

We use CAN for communication with the electronic components of the car that we do not make (Tritium Motor Controllers and MPPTs). Everywhere else we use Ethernet and SPI.

Here are a few good overviews of how CAN works:
