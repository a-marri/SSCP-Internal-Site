This page on the internal site technically pertains to team leadership, but it has lots of great advice for the team in general. This page is about being engineering lead, but also has some great gems.

### Solarcar Universal Truths(that aren't obvious)

* The best team members are the most likely to fail
* Any problem requires a minimum of two
* Your competition are less perfect than they look&#x20;

The best team members are the most likely to fail

Any problem requires a minimum of two

Your competition are less perfect than they look&#x20;

I've uploaded some PDFs of very old documents about things that can go wrong and general advice about building a good team. Highlights:

"Working late is generally an awful idea unless there is an honest threat of an imminent deadline. It is bad for morale, quality drops off, frustration levels rise, and efficiency plummets. The pain of lack of sleep begins to become intimately associated with the project."

"Everything is more expensive, time consuming, difficult, and painful than originally anticipated."

"No one system -- chassis, suspension, aerodynamics, or even array -- ever won any race. It is only the wise fusion of all of these technologies, and the lack of significant failure of any, that does."

"If done to its full potential, this is one of the most demanding, challenging, exciting, exhilerating, depressing, frustrating, educational, and formative experiences in your life."

"Make people personally, explicitly responsible for things."

"Reduce the need to think on the spot. An impulsive answer is rarely as good as one that was thought through with the benefit of time."

11pm on a Saturday night on week three and only Anna and Harry are here?

There is no way on Earth that you all will finish your car in time for summer test driving yet alone Aerodyn with the current effort from the team. If you all aren't putting in two or three times as many hours this quarter as you are now you'll be hard pressed to have a car ready for Australia. Last cycle Greg and I were in the shop well over a hundred hours a week every week during spring quarter. Most of the team leadership were at the shop at least 40 hours a week if they were in classes or working. The general team members were busy as well and putting in strong hours each week.

It takes a lot of time and motivation to build a solar car.

Please don't be yet another Stanford team who doesn't finish building your car until you are in Australia.

Thanks for sensing this out, Wesley. Today wasn't as productive as Wednesday, for example. There are lots of things where we could be putting in more work hours overall and some things where we can't yet start to work.

So we can understand this better, where in the process was the car around now?

to Guillermo, Stanford

As a team lead, I'd like to clarify my absence personally. I put in a long day at the shop Friday (until 5am) and worked most of today, but I felt I was working pretty slowly and ineffectively after dinner due to lack of sleep. I felt I was better off going home, doing some non-physical work, and getting some sleep, so I can get back in the shop tomorrow after getting some rest. I'll be in at 9:30 or so tomorrow and I'll be working until late.&#x20;

I plan on finishing all of the trimming of the gap fills tomorrow so the bottomshell is finished and ready to glue Monday.

I think it's less about checking the boxes and comparing ourselves to what was glued two years ago and what wasn't at this point, and more about the general culture, mentality, vision, etc. of the team.

&#x20;

Thanks for sending this out, Wesley, and for still being here at 12:30am on your own Saturday night to have realtalks with Harry, Guillermo, and myself about all things solar car. And while I'm at it, thanks to all the alumni for always seeming accessible and willing to help us build this car.

Jamie, I think it's totally understandable/sensible to rest after however late you were up doing the gap-fill layup. I think general sanity and personal well-being are important too, and I don't think anyone's begrudging you for not being at the shop right now.

But I think that as a team we still have some figuring out to do as far as where we think we're headed and what we're on track for. Again, not just in terms of calendars and dates and deadlines, but also as people and as a team.  &#x20;

The fact that we had five people out of school dedicated to Solar Car let the 2013 team pull even further ahead in the rest of Spring Quarter.

Thanks for the reality check, Wesley! Management wisdom is always appreciated, especially because I personally have relatively little.

Hey guys--

I just wanted to chime in as someone who is totally willing to help but has no idea what to do when it comes to actually building the car. When I'm there on Mondays and Saturdays I'm usually doing code team or business stuff, but those are (mostly) projects I could be doing anywhere. I usually drop by the mech bay and see if there's anything low skill I can help out with, but it's rarely clear to me where I can just jump in and I'm worried about getting in the way. I also see emails pretty frequently inviting people to come help out with work sessions but it usually sounds like tasks above my skillset, so I'm super hesitant to bike all the way across campus only to watch other people work. And I think I'm probably not the only one.

My point is this: I can spend a few more evenings a week at VAIL easily if it would be helpful, and I'm guessing there are more people like me, but I'm never sure when is a good time to head over. If there's ever some big repetitive task going on where someone could explain for a few minutes and set me loose, please include that in the email announcing the work session! My guess is a few more people will show up.

to Colvin, me, Stanford

Alumnus here, 2¢.

First, let me start with the statement that I've been on the other side of the country this entire build cycle, so I can't say anything specific about how the team has been doing.

I do have something to say about involvement, though.

Solar car cannot be sustained without the team leadership, the people who lead design projects, the Wesleys and Gregswho spend 100+ hours at the shop. However, the team also does not function if the only help those few people have are people who are afraid to come in because they feel like they have absolutely no idea what they're doing.

Basically everyone leading the team, myself included (2013 mech lead/suspension/aerodynamics design), went to their first team meeting, and their second, and even their tenth meeting with a nagging feeling that they knew absolutely jack shit about what's going on, how all of this works, or how to be useful.

There was really only one thing that separated those of us who kept coming back, and that was not giving a shit that we had no idea what we were doing and realizing our passion for the awesome stuff that was happening with the project far outweighed the fact that we felt way out of our league. That's what kept us coming back, and that's how the people you see leading the team now ended up leading the team. You suck it up, deal with the feeling that you feel like a total impostor hanging out with a bunch of engineers who seem way out of your league skills-wise, and go to the shop and stay there until someone tells you to go get some sleep. Do this enough and without realizing that anything has changed, you'll be the next mech lead, the next BMS designer, the next lead aerodynamicist, the next team manager.

Personally, I _literally_ failed more than a few classes while working on solar car. I was suspended from school for a year, and I'm still finishing my degree because of that. That didn't even come up when I interviewed for my summer job at Tesla, or my 6 month gig with Apple - all they wanted to talk about was what I had had my hands on at the solar car shop. That's not an exaggeration.

If you want to work on the car, go work on the car. if you don't know what to do, ask. if you still don't know, ask someone else. if you still don't understand, look it up yourself and read something about it, and if you don't understand what you're reading, ask someone about that. If you don't feel like you belong in a group of talented engineers doing hard work, remember that you got into Stanford just like everyone else and convince yourself that you absolutely /do/ belong - and then go _make_ it that way. Do anything but have an excuse for why you're not at the shop building a world-class solar car. Take it personally when the people around you do make those excuses.

I just wanted to clarify my position a little lest it look like I'm not trying or don't care. I'm a CS major and I do a lot for the team on code and business projects -- I'm not an ME person, I never will be, and, frankly, I don't really want to be. But it looks to me like they are short on hands on that side of things right now and if I can help relieve that pressure by all means I want to! I've been on the team for two years, I know how things work around the shop, but not at all about building things.

-list, +only leadership (this isn't really meant for public distribution)

There will be plenty of debate about the topic in general, and actually agree with most of what Golshan said. That being said, (and this probably goes without saying) I absolutely and unequivocally disagree with the last sentence, and want to make sure that no one goes down that path. As leads, I feel you can and should excite, incentivize, cajole, and to some degree very lightly threaten (god help anyone who is useless and puts in absolutely no work then asks me for a reference later down the line) your team members. Do not, however take anyone else's failings personally, as I believe that that is probably the fastest path to burnout that exists. You can wonder "Hmm, is there anything I should have done better to make sure that team member is engaged in the project?" or questions that are similar, but if you start to consider it a personal affront when someone (especially a newer member) makes excuses about why they're not here, you're going to pretty quickly drop down a rabbit hole of rage and sadness.    &#x20;

I'm going to be generous with benefit of the doubt and assume that it was just a last-minute afterthought to close the paragraph, but I still wanted to make my feelings on the matter known explicitly.&#x20;

Thank you Harry for addressing this.

Kelsey, I thought you made a good point that we might be forgetting about people who might be intimidated or unsure about what to do, and I also thought Golshan responded in a somewhat unfair tone. We want our team to be open to those who are willing to put in the time, and we don't want to create the insular feeling that a person needs to stick around feeling uncomfortable until finally they get it.

I wasn't sure how to reply/felt uncomfortable replying, but I feel like someone should end the email thread looping back to Wesley's original point and encouraging inexperienced members to jump in.

to Colvin, me, Stanford

Hi Colvin and everyone else,

Thanks for your thoughts.&#x20;

Colvin, I think your perspective is very valuable. You've put into words what many new members feel. I felt this, too back in the day. I would appreciate hearing your thoughts anytime, via email or in person. Please feel welcome at the shop and on the team, and I hope to see you around VAIL even if it is a bit far. I remember meeting you briefly and I remember that you study materials science. Other than that, I don't know much else.&#x20;

I often see familiar faces around campus and I remember who's been to a meeting. Basically every ME in my classes has at one point been to a solar car meeting and dropped out because of impatience or the steep learning curve. It's very hard to keep track of everything and everyone now that our team is larger than ever (I do think so based on the numbers). Many solar car teams around the world are smaller than ours.&#x20;

It's proven very hard to sustain the energy necessary to keep bringing in new members and keeping them interested when things get rough for everyone with design, analysis, building, deadlines, etc. We were more focused on this earlier in the cycle (last year, early this school year) but now other things have taken precedence. It's also difficult to subdivide projects in a perfect way because some projects can't be effectively divided and everything has a deadline so commitment is key. Unfortunately we don't do much fundamental materials science but you can find a way to learn CAD or help assemble things.&#x20;

I didn't get consistently involved in solar car until Spring quarter of my Freshman year, when I helped Matt Matera and Wesley make solar modules for Luminos. Over the summer I also helped a lot in test drives. These were both versions of grunt work but I had fun and learned a lot. It took time and to this day I still do grunt work mixed in with everything else that happens in my role in the background, like fundraising, setting deadlines, designing things, doing outreach and media events, etc.&#x20;

I think we need more leadership from team leaders. There are things I can do as well as the overall team lead, though every time discussions like these come up they serve as reminders to do the great things we know we should already be doing.&#x20;

I think we can do a better job of being around at the shop and being more excited. In exchange for your time and the time of others, we will do our best to make room for you to contribute to the project in whatever way you can.&#x20;

ON THAT NOTE

We do have a lot of work to do to make this car come together. I hope to see you all at the shop. Please don't feel intimidated or disappointed. I will try harder to make things more accessible for everyone, and hope the rest of the leadership will help me out as well.&#x20;

Wesley, thanks for catching this and for pointing out the uncomfortable. Your perspective is always appreciated here.&#x20;

Sincerely,&#x20;

don't worry, I wasn't trying to call you out. just making a general point about team membership, especially for the people who are mech inclined who aren't coming out. I know you've been around and helping out in various capacities for a while, definitely wasn't directed at you. sorry if it came off that way.

Wesley's completely right, we have our work cut out for us if we want to get Arctan to Aerodyn.

We can either treat that as a source of dread, or a source of inspiration.

In the midst of all this debate about specifics, let's not lose track of the scope and ambition of what we're doing. We're building a car, from scratch, to compete in the premier solar car race in the world. We're following up our most successful finish ever with a car that will be faster if we execute it properly. And we are going to make this car materialize over the next seven weeks. If that doesn't get you fired up, I don't know what will.

Think about what it will feel like to see Arctan in the wind tunnel in June. Look at the pictures of Luminos at Aerodyn and think about the car YOU HELPED BUILD doing that. Think about arriving in Australia with a car you've finished well in advance, tested thoroughly, and are confident will take whatever the continent throws at you. You can also think about what will happen if we fail, if you must, or simply focus on what must be done to ensure that you don't. Think about Bryant Tan, the namesake of this car, whose name you will honor if we build this car the way it deserves to be built.

As Guillermo said, I understand how it can be hard for newer members, and I personally promise to do my best to reach out and meet you halfway. But you have to come meet us with the other half. As the student in the UNSW post said, there's no one pushing you, paying you, or holding your hand through this process. If you can't get stoked about what this team is going to accomplish this quarter, I doubt anything we can do or say can motivate you enough to accomplish what we need to accomplish. If you feel what you're doing isn't making any tangible difference on the car, you're wrong. We have way too much to do to waste your time with projects that don't matter. As a new member, I was blown away that anything I could do could contribute to something like Luminos. I encourage you all to think that way now. &#x20;

Our current situation reminds me of a pregame speech by one of our seniors when I was on the lacrosse team here. During our first game of the season,our captain Bart told us how Hernan Cortez's first act upon arriving in the New World was to set fire to his entire fleet, to let his men know that the only way out was forward. Regardless of his questionable actions in the Americas after his arrival, you cannot help but respect a man who so firmly believes that success is his only option. Our ships have been nothing but ashes for months now; there's no going back. It's do or die from here on out. If there ever were a time to quit, it was a year and a half ago. Not putting in the effort now to finish this thing would be a disservice who have worked so hard to bring us so far.

On that note, I'll be in the shop until around 2 tonight, and Harry will be around late as well. I believe Harry needs some help gluing in the last of the cable guide grommets, and thanks to Anna we now have a full whiteboard of other tasks people can work on.

Let's get stoked about what we're doing. The endeavor we've undertaken is incredibly exciting, even if we sometimes forget about that in the melee of countless tasks we need to get done. Let's never lose sight of that, and allow our excitement to make sure we put in the work we need to do.

Hey all,

Another two cents here:

If things aren't making sense, ask questions. If someone isn't answering your questions, go ask someone else. Keep asking until you get good answers.

If someone is asking you questions, answer them. The way we keep this team rolling is by passing on our knowledge. You will help newer members by teaching, and you will help yourself by explaining. If you can't explain something properly you probably don't understand it.

My coworkers have repeatedly commented on my willingness to ask questions, and to keep asking questions until I really understand (instead of accepting partial answers). They comment on this more than on my ability to just solve problems off the bat.

If the mech team is working they're probably short on hands and need someone to help hold things in place, sand, or apply glue. Walk in there, ask for a job or jump in where help is obviously needed, and while you're doing that grunt work, ask some questions about what you're doing and why, or what the next steps are and when you should be there to help.

And everyone can help with bondo.

Rachel

P.s.: A big thanks to Sam D'Amico and Sasha Zbrozek for always answering my questions when I was on the team. I learned a ton from you.

I think in the 2011 and 2013 build cycles we had a lot of really good conversations on how to become an awesome team member.  This is something that I think a lot of people have some intuition for but it isn't always articulated in a succinct way:

* remember you are pretty smart and awesome.
* ask a ton of questions and grow a lot.  Don't think you can't do something.  I think most people stray a bit from their area of study in terms of team contributions.
* don't feel afraid to dive into something you don't (yet) understand.  No one really learns solar car in high school - the difference between you and team leadership is just time.
* don't be afraid to help out on something that isn't your main thing; sooner or later you will be an expert at that too.
* listen to everyone else as they're also smart and awesome.
* the other secret of solar car is that you'll learn just as much about team dynamics, what motivates your friends, and personal / professional interactions as you will learn about the technical stuff.

The end result is the people who follow this rulebook become _beyond versatile_ and are incredibly good recruiting targets for jobs.  The difference between a dedicated member and a new member is that the dedicated member realizes that they're actually getting paid - enough to warrant working your butt off.  The free (and extremely awesome) training, hanging out with some awesome people, and fruitful career are totally worth it, and extremely hard to rival anywhere else.

And yes, sanding bondo does lead directly to jobs at Google, Facebook, Tesla, SpaceX, etc...

I rarely comment on Solar Car threads these days, but just wanted to jump in and say that I think one of the (many) things Wesley did during his leadership that was particularly effective was keeping a list of tasks that needed to get done and often putting them in emails when he invited people to work sessions. It obviously wasn't an exhaustive list, but I think it was helpful to have a general idea of tasks that needed to get done. I know that I personally dropped by a few times to help out with vinyl wrapping despite being pretty detached from the whole Luminos cycle simply because Wesley would send out emails asking for help and I had the time + knew it was an easy task I could help with.&#x20;

It's easy to talk about people needing to be dedicated enough to come and hang around and be willing to feel like they are useless... BUT I also think that just because that is the way it has been in the past doesn't mean that it is the only way to become an effective and dedicated team member. I guess what I'm trying to say is, yes, it's important to realize as an inexperienced member that you are going to feel out of your depth and you are often going to be the one who needs to take the time to change that... but it's also just as important for the leadership to try to reduce the time that they feel that way.
