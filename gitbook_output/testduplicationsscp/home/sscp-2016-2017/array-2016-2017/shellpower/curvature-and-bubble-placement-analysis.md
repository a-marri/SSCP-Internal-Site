# SSCP - Curvature and Bubble Placement Analysis

# Curvature and Bubble Placement Analysis

Attached is the STL for TDP-031, which we will use for the array curvature and bubble placement analysis.

1) Curvature analysis:

Config A: string of cells on very edge of the car.

Config B: string of cells on flat body of car.

2) Bubble Placement Analysis:

Config A: 4 independent, realistic modules as close to bubble as possible (right against edge).

Config B: Config A shifted over 5cm.

Config C: Config A shifted over 10cm.

Config D: Config A shifted over 15cm.

Config E: config A shifted over 20cm.

For each of these, run a full race day at Coober Pedy; modify the attached .json file to create your sample run.Â  You may use the attached array file as a template, or make your own using the blank template which is in the Shellpower directory from Github.
