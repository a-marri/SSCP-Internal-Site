Shriram

before 1: Make sure ELed.&#x20;

take off white squares if needed with tape method (put painters tape on fingers, use that to stick onto the square and pull them up with minimal movement on the cell itself).&#x20;

1. Check tabs to make sure correct (everything except 16- is an i-tab or H-tab or whatever you want to call it).&#x20;
2. Make sure the cardboard you use is sized correctly and does not bend in the middle (if bends, add more cardboard supports with corrugation perpendicular to the bend) (or use a different one).
3. Tape cardboard shut with dog-eared tape
4. Use bad vacuum bag to seal (with painter tape) the cardboard
5. Transport to VAIL in a car (not bike nor walking).&#x20;

Parallel Processes (threading):

Encapsulant, topsheet and backsheet can be cut at same time

Encapsulant can get started one tape goes down (during step 4, or even earlier because it takes a while)

Cut tabs in posterboard while it’s in oven

Start overcutting release film, breather, vacuum bag a few steps before they’re needed

IPA the vacuum hose while the breather is being cut to size

Clean up while module is in the oven.&#x20;

VAIL:

prep:&#x20;

Turn on oven to 190, check shelves

Get table space and wipe it down beforehand

1 table per glass, 1 table for encapsulant cutting, and small table for materials

5 minute run-through of encapsulation process with everyone involved, communicate about white space and others.&#x20;

Note: Use measuring tape whenever cutting to make sure cutting out enough + extra to make it easy to place (usually 2”  or more is good in each dimension)

1. Check to make sure no Goo-gone residue (Clean with lots of acetone until finger tugs on it when you slide on it. If double-sided tape doesn’t stick, you need more acetone).
2. Determine size of module + blank space (look at yoga mat)
3. Lay down double-sided tape: Keep in mind that whole module + blank space + some extra around yoga mat must fit easily inside double-sided tape

3a. Make sure enough room for vacuum tape as well.&#x20;

3b. Put on gloves! (and any hair protection you need)

4. Overcut blue release film (Econolease), lay it on the double-sided tape (stretch it out so that if you run your hand over it, no wrinkles should build up).&#x20;
5. Trim Econolease with fabric (zigzag) scissors as close to the tape as possible. Must leave enough room for vacuum tape. Also cover all of double-sided tape
6. Overcut topsheet (wrinkles easily, so two person job — one hold, one cut. Also, careful rolling it up that no wrinkles are created)
7. Wiping:&#x20;

7a. Use clean microfiber to wipe Econolease with long wipes that wipe things off the glass — not circular wipes

7b. Sharpie test on a corner (NOTE: some sharpies will work on both sides, so test both sides)

7b2. Lay topsheet down onto Econolease with cell-side down&#x20;

7c. Wipe down the air-side same way as last time with same microfiber (note: easier with two people)

7d. Pick up topsheet

7e. Wipe down Econolease

7f. Lay down topsheet the right way (cell-side/sharpie side up)

7g. Wipe topsheet down

8. Encapsulant:&#x20;

8a. Wipe cutting board with IPA

8b. Cut encapsulant (mostly) to size — leave room for white space and a little bit extra for trimming and then more extra (note that more extra makes it much easier to place)

8c. Don’t close encapsulant bag until release film goes on&#x20;

8d. Leave encapsulant on cutting board/mat until we need it.&#x20;

9. Flip module blue-side up, if still white squares, EL it. (go back to Shriram)

9b. Make sure tabs are right geometry

10. Put one layer of (cut-to-size) encapsulant on top of the blue side of the cells
11. Tape vacuum bag to back of the board that you’ll be laying the cells down with.&#x20;
12. Check your area to make sure no problems  flipping

12a. Flip module (two people if large module or if not 100% sure it will be a success) (proper flipping = firm pressure on the middle or where module is with a quick flip).&#x20;

13. Take module and drag off of posterboard onto topsheet (position it well to begin with — cells + white space inside of double-sided tape, and keep it that way for the full module

13a. Person holding posterboard: keep it low and mostly parallel to glass, slowly drag back, watch out for raising too much at end, grip in the middle of the posterboard for better control at the end of it. (always one person, two people = too many cooks in kitchen)

14a. Wipe back of cells with dry microfiber&#x20;

14b. Lay other sheet of encapsulant on the module

15. Trim #1: trim encapsulant to be within topsheet, leaving enough room for white space + extra so it can be trimmed

16a. Clean backsheet with a clean paper towel or microfiber

16b. Lay backsheet on, trim it to be within topsheet (doesn’t need much extra space)

17. Trim encapsulant to make sure at least 1/4” to 1/2” away from both backsheet and topsheet, LEAVING ROOM FOR WHITE SPACE AND EXTRA FOR POST-ENCAP TRIMMING
18. Cut tabs!!!!!!!!!!! (Take the correct angle that will minimize the amount of cut length on car-ready module; cut tabs for encapsulant closer to edge of cell, and for backsheet slightly more toward middle; if confused, ask John).&#x20;
19. If tabs are cut, Use a sharpie to mark the positive and negative terminals as well as module name (note: place them toward middle of module, so that they don’t get trimmed off).&#x20;

19a. Shove some perforated release film between tab and on top of backsheet

20. Ask John to do quality control.&#x20;
21. Lay down vacuum tape (cut topsheet if it encroaches on the vacuum tape — BE VERY CAREFUL WITH THAT TO MAKE SURE IT DOESN’T SLIP/MOVE)
22. Overcut blue perforated release film and breather (use measuring tape)
23. Lay down blue perforated release film (use a hand to make sure the backsheet is flat for this)
24. Trim down blue perforated release film (use a second person to hold down the middle, which has happy side effect of flattening backsheet as well) (leave 1/8” from vacuum tape so it doesn’t stick)

23a. Make sure release film goes at least 1/4” past edge of backsheet.&#x20;

24. Lay down breather

24a. Cut breather to size — over edge of topsheet, but don’t need it beyond that.  (also make sure doesn’t come into contact with vacuum tape

25. Make sure no exposed double-sided tape
26. IPA the hose

26a. Wrap the hose in vacuum tape

26b. Lay hose under breather, over perforated release film, and away from cells&#x20;

27b. If possible lay hose mostly parallel to tape, far to the left of the hole (so at least 12” away from the right edge of the glass).&#x20;

27c. Vacuum tape bridge around the hose, this will be harder if you do it mostly parallel. Do your best <3

27. Cut out vacuum bag (two people unless Jonah, and make sure hold it by one corner and don’t wrinkle it at all. ever.)
28. Lay down vacuum bag (two people, do the hose first and then smooth out the rest to try to minimize wrinkling once pull vacuum).&#x20;

28b. First time, lay down very gently (minimal pressure on tape) so that you can pick it back up if needed.&#x20;

29. Pull vacuuuuuuuum.&#x20;
30. Fix vacuum if needed (stethoscope?)
31. Attach good (woven cord cover) thermocouple in center of glass on top of vacuum bag with kapton tape sandwich (kapton on bag, thermocouple on kapton, another piece of kapton on the thermocouple)another piece of tape to tape the thermocouple near the vacuum tape).&#x20;

31a. Use Flashbreaker (red) tape to tape the vacuum bag to the glass near the vacuum tube.&#x20;

32a. Put on oven PPE

32b. Put in oven (lower shelf, >= two people (two only if very careful), keep vacuum by pinching tube while bringing it there.&#x20;

32c. Connect thermocouple to Extech by threading it through the crack in the doors&#x20;

33. Turn on Extech, start logging (hold power button to turn on, then hold “Set/Log” button to start logging)
34. Keep oven at 190,

34a. Cut out holes for tabs in the posterboard using the yoga mat (make sure correct orientation, so use the top side up).&#x20;

34b. Wait until thermocouple hits 180 C, then turn oven down and open doors slightly (takes \~30 - 40 minutes, but keep checking in intervals)

34c. Set to 20 C before opening doors or you will need gloves to change the set point because the heat will come out of the oven.&#x20;

36. After 10ish minutes of cooling, open doors wide open.&#x20;
37. Once it hits \~50 C, you can bring it outside (pinching to keep vacuum) and keep it under vacuum until it hits roughly 35 C (slightly warm).&#x20;
38. Either turn off oven or turn it up again for the next encapsulation.

prep:&#x20;

Affix protection to glass edges (large glass = whole perimeter, small glass = at least corners) (protection is vacuum tape covered in kapton, may use breather instead of vacuum tape if low on vacuum tape)

Get table space and wipe it down beforehand

1 table per glass, 1 table for encapsulant cutting, and small table for materials

Clean steel vacuum ports with IPA (3 ports/big glass, 2 ports/small glass)

25.a) Cut breather to size — so that is goes to 1/4” away from vacuum tape&#x20;

26.Make sure no exposed double-sided tape

27.Cut 5” squares of breather for the vacuum ports (3 ports/big glass, 2 ports/small glass)

28.Place ports on breather squares well spaced on top of breather, at least about 3” away from vacuum tape (For 3 ports place each towards a corner of the glass, for 2 ports place each centered on each short edge). (Note: use steel ports (they’re heavier))

29.Cut out vacuum bag (two people unless Jonah, and make sure hold it by one corner and don’t wrinkle it at all. ever.)

30.Have two people hold vacuum bag taught above the tape while a third person  uses a sharpie to mark the location of each port with an “X”

31.Move vacuum bag to a clean prep area and unscrew ports

32.Trace metal O-ring from port (the piece that sits directly above the rubber seal) (most of these have a notch in the inner perimeter)

33.Cut away the vacuum bag where you traced (usually works well to trim just to the outside (1 mm) of the traced sharpie circle)

34.Move vacuum bag back to encapsulation stack. While two people hover the bag (like before) have a third person place the holes in the bag over the ports (which should be unscrewed with the metal o-ring removed) and push the ports through.

35.Check placement of ports and then lay down bag by starting at one edge laying down gently and smoothing out so there are no wrinkles.

36.Secure metal ring (with the ridge UP) and screw down ports (careful not to wrinkle bag in the seal).

37.Attach vacuum port valve to a hose and plug his into port and vacuum

38.Pull vacuuuuuuuum.&#x20;

39.Fix vacuum if needed (stethoscope?)&#x20;

40.Use 2” Flashbreaker (red) tape over the edge of the vacuum bag around the entire perimeter of the glass.&#x20;

Loading the Van:

Note: Array members must be present for loading and unloading of van.

1.Remove Seats (for however much space is required, i.e. 2 big glasses require all the space (no seats)).

2.Empty the Rear of the van (no debris or random items).

3.Fold breather into three layers and secure (flash breaker tape) to the seat supports.

4.Load each piece of glass into van (2 people minimum).&#x20;

5.Secure pieces of glass for transit.

Post-SSL and Post-VAIL:

1. Make sure at room temperature
2. Take off Flashbreaker tape
3. Turn pump off, disconnect vacuum hose (allows you to pick up vacuum tape more easily because tape isn’t holding vacuum anymore)
4. Use razor blade to cut the vacuum bag on the inside perimeter making sure the blade is extended into the vacuum tape rather than the glass

4a. Make sure vacuum tape isn’t connected to vacuum bag&#x20;

5. Pull back vacuum bag parallel to glass, carefully making sure breather doesn’t come with it.&#x20;
6. Pull back breather and perforated release film, pull parallel to glass, make sure module does not come with it. This is more difficult and will take extra attention.&#x20;
7. Make sure topsheet is not stuck to anything (double-sided tape, vacuum tape, etc)

7a. Carefully lift module up, making sure it only bends on one main axis.&#x20;

8. Lay module on its posterboard in a safe location, and tape module down to posterboard with tabs in right place.&#x20;
9. Remove vacuum tape, Econolease, etc. and clean the glass with Goo-Gone and then acetone to remove the Goo-Gone.&#x20;
10. Use bad vacuum bag from Shriram (which should have come with the module) to seal the two posterboards together with painters tape.&#x20;
