Summer Schedule

Week 1 (June 20 - 26)

Flash Tester:  &#x20;

&#x20;   Hang curtains all around, curtain on floor, and curtain on wall.&#x20;

&#x20;   Kate's crimping solution

&#x20;   Integrate the temperature probe

&#x20;   Characterize the 2-cell module very, very, very well

&#x20;   Characterize 1-cell module very, very, very well -- figure out standard deviation, etc.&#x20;

&#x20;   Then, characterize the 10 one-cell modules we have in the box labelled "Kat's samples"

&#x20;       This will let Logan do UV Testing -- ideally, we want this done by the end of the week
