Summer Schedule

Week 1 (June 20 - 26)

Flash Tester:   

    Hang curtains all around, curtain on floor, and curtain on wall. 

    Kate's crimping solution

    Integrate the temperature probe

    Characterize the 2-cell module very, very, very well

    Characterize 1-cell module very, very, very well -- figure out standard deviation, etc. 

    Then, characterize the 10 one-cell modules we have in the box labelled "Kat's samples"

        This will let Logan do UV Testing -- ideally, we want this done by the end of the week
