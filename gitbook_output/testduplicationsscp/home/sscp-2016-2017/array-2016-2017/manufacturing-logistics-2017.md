Diagonal Tests and Bond Strength Issues:

* Large glass module requires two vacuumsSingle vacuum pulls 25 in. hg, two vacuums pull 28 in. hgLesson Learned: less pressure --> less bond strengthAll modules: once in oven, do not start timer until oven equilibrates to 170; leave at temp for 15 minLesson Learned: Longer (>15min) and hotter (>170C) encapsulations make for beautiful modulesOnce we switched to 15 minutes starting when the oven hits 170, we got great bond strength on the diagonal modules!One note is that the longer time working well may be because of vacuum -- the vacuum steadily increases as time goes on, so maybe we just need to leave it in that long so that we get good vacuum.&#x20;

More Bond Strength Notes:

* Some modules still had bond strength issues/bubbles near corners after being encapsulated a second timeMost of these issues (initial and subsequent encaps alike) can be attributed to a leaky vacuum seal, often caused by the oven door pulling/pushing the vacuum hose enough to stretch the vacuum tape and breach its seal.A patchwork fix to poor bond strength: use DP-105 (epoxy) to seal the top sheet to the encapsulant.apply a strip of the epoxy to the leading edge of the top sheet, i.e. in the location that top sheet still connects to encapsulant. take a yellow squeegee and apply an even pressure to the area of the top sheet that has been pulled up, as you pull the squeegee towards the edge of the cellsmake sure no epoxy got on the squeegee, as you are going to need more than one pass over the top of the cells to ensure no bubbles are in the epoxied area.clean up with paper towels as you go to keep the top of the cells epoxy freethe epoxy tends to wrinkle the top sheet as it cures; to counter this, take several pieces of tape and apply sheer force in the directions normal to the wrinkles. The top sheet should flatten out entirely--once this position is achieved, stick the other end of the tape to a nearby surface and wait at least 15 minutes to remove the tape.the module should now have beautiful bond strength, no wrinkles, and (hopefully) no drops or smears of epoxy on the top of the top sheet.

Tasks that should be done by end of each meeting:

* Plan out module -- what cells are we using, where do ultras go (if they'll be on there), where will positive and negative ends goPrint out picture of module?
* Print out picture of module?
* Tape module
* Solder module
* While 1-2 ppl taping/soldering, third should EL the module that was made last time <-- this may be shifted to the end of each meeting so that people can learn from soldering mistakesCatalogue EL test (with a note on orientation of the module) on the internal site so that we can compare it to later.
* Catalogue EL test (with a note on orientation of the module) on the internal site so that we can compare it to later.
* Lay soldered module onto a piece of cardboard and cover with clean-room paper
* Stack module onto rack? We'll see how this goes in the future

4 backup

10 backup

SunPower visit 4/28/17:

Laminated two modules, one with minimal tape, the other with maximum tape (tape on all sides, one looooong piece per side).&#x20;

&#x20;   Maximum tape worked much better, minimal wrinkling with only small wrinkles.&#x20;

Also binned 100 cells

&#x20;   Saw a noticeable difference between the two batches of cells that we tested

&#x20;   Also decided that we should number each cell and sort after each session of binning
