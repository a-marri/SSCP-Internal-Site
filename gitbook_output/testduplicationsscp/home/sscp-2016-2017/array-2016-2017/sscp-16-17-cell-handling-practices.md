## SSCP 16-17 Cell Handling Practices

1. Always wear gloves when touching bare cells or things surrounding bare cells
2. Always store cells on a flat surface (if for a long time, a surface that won’t outgas)clean-room paper works for thisCells are silicon crystals on top of some metal contacts; the crystal will break easily if it’s deformed, but if you were to put it on a totally flat surface and stomp on it, it wouldn’t break (can confirm, I did something similar to test this out). So, moral of the story here is that when stacking them, you have to be very careful to use a material that won’t bend. But, then you also want to be careful to not put undue pressure on the solder joints. This cycle, we stacked them using foam poster boards, which we found worked pretty well — it’s a good combo of overall stiffness with some flexibility to account for solder joints. You can’t do more than 2-3 on a single stack, though, because it gets heavy and bends. If you need more space, try getting a rack with lots of shelves; we tried to find one for us, but they're surprisingly expensive and not many people make them how we want in the sizes we want.&#x20;

* They degrade with moisture, and we found that one of our cell stacks (like the 150 cells that come in a stack) tested out at \~23.7% when it should have been \~24.1 ish. They had been left out while open, and the most likely explanation is some small UV degradation combined with moisture degradation.&#x20;

1. Store cells in an environment with no light to avoid UV degradation (small effect that affects different cells differently; no way to tell beforehand how it will go for each cell).&#x20;
2. Only set cells down on clean surfaces, try to avoid moving them afterward.&#x20;
3. Avoid talking toward face-up bare cells in order to not spit on them (or use a mask/filter thingy that goes on your mouth).
