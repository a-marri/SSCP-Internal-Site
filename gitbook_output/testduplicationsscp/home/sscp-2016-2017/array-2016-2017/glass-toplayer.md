Derek Wang: Meeting with Director of Solar Technologies at PPG, Dr. James McCamy

Hey, all. This morning I met with the director of solar technologies at PPG and asked him for his thoughts on a glass encapsulation layer. Apologies in advance if what I'm saying is disjointed. He doesn't think glass is a good idea for the solar car. The first glass he thought of was the Corning Willow glass, which someone brought up at meeting a few times. It can be just 100 microns thick. It even comes in a roll, as if to prove that it's super flexible. The thing is that it's flexible one-dimensionally (like a toilet paper), but not two-dimensionally, which is what we need for the aerodynamics of the car. Furthermore, we would need low iron glass, but he's not sure whether Corning makes Willow glass like that. He says he could help us get 1.5 mm glass, but we would need to spend a lot of money getting it fitted to the car. Also, to ensure that the cells don't shatter, we would also need to get a back layer. That's 3 mm of glass total which could be really expensive and heavy. Another thing is that we were all a little concerned that the anti-reflective coatings would only work well from certain angles, but he said that technology exists that is pretty much good from any angle. Finally, he mentioned one more thing that's not necessarily glass-related: texturing. PPG has using pyramid-shapes (on the order of microns tall) on its glass for increased absorption. They basically roll it on with a cylindrical stamp. What was most intriguing is that he mentioned that you can physically feel the roughness of the pyramids, even though they're just microns tall, AKA wind would be able to feel it, too. Before we go all out with texturing, we need to think about the effect on aerodynamics. Anyway, that's it. See you all Sunday!

(note from John: Chuzel and Gochermann have done tests on aero, and said the effect is minimal)

Hey Glass people! To reiterate my earlier email, the goal for this week is to find 3-5 sponsors that we can email on Sunday.&#x20;

I've already got two, so try to each find at least one possible sponsor this week.&#x20;

List of Possible Sponsors:

Ducatt (glass may not bend enough, though)

Corning

Lisec Thin Glass

AGC Solar

NSG

Sono Tek
