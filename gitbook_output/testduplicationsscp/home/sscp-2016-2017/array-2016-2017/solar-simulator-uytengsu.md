Notes on how to work it:

&#x20;   Use the EC-lab program on the desktop (Workstation 1)

&#x20;   Make sure channel corresponds to the cable you're using (channel select is in the top left, it looks like (1 2 3 4)

&#x20;   THere's an error message like "Channel Overload" that basically means that you're putting too much current into it or that the voltage is too high (something along those lines).&#x20;

&#x20;   To design a new test, look at box in lower left, click +, make sure you have IV sweep (or IV curve, not sure which) selected, then click OK, then set all the parameters, then click the green arrow button at the bottom of the box to run it!

&#x20;   Connect the red wire to the positive lead, and then both the blue wire and the white wire to the negative lead.

&#x20;       Can do this by plugging the white wire into the back of the blue wire

&#x20;       Check labels on wire to see what is what

&#x20;   Once it's been run, you can take the data and put it in Excel

&#x20;       Right click on the data/graph window, go to "Copy", then it'll pull up another thing; from there, select "copy data" and then paste it into Excel and save the Excel file!

When you're done with the simulator, log how long you used it in the "Solar Simulator log-book" (a red composition book), just so that they know when to start thinking about replacing new bulbs.
