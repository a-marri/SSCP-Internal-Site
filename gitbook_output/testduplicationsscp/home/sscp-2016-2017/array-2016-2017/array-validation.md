Reported 115.9V and 2.36A = 273 W

A0, A1, B0, B1 plugged in, total of 2.06 m^2 (B0 is diced)

According to https://www.wunderground.com/personal-weather-station/dashboard?ID=KCAMOUNT75#history (closest weather station with pyranometer we could find) insolation was 574 W/m^2

Expected encapsulation efficiency of 98% on cells that started at 24.1% efficient, we expect 23.61% efficiency

Therefore expected performance = 574 * 2.06 * .2361 = 279 W

So this half array was making 6W fewer than expected yielding observed efficiency of 23.1%

Assumptions:

* Insolation at VAIL = insolation at weather stationCurrent and voltage sense completely accurate
* Insolation at VAIL = insolation at weather station
* Current and voltage sense completely accurate

1. Insolation at VAIL = insolation at weather station
2. Current and voltage sense completely accurate

Insolation at VAIL = insolation at weather station

Current and voltage sense completely accurate
