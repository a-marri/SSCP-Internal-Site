# SSCP - Textured AR

# Textured AR

Hey Textured AR people! To reiterate my earlier email, the goal for this week is to find 3-5 sponsors that we can email on Sunday. If you're on the theory part of Textured AR, try to do some work on that as well; but, I think we might put that on hold until midterms are over and we all have the brainpower to devote to actually learning stuff that's not to do with classes. 

Sponsors Contacted:

Telaztec -- sending a sample, willing to work with us to scale up if needed

    May need to make smaller modules, but we can do that. 

    Pros: UV Hardcoat (wiping/touching is fine), can texture both sides, >99% transmission measured (by them, so grain of salt)

    Cons: Right now limited to 5"x5", but have industry contacts who might be willing to help scale up. 

ios Optics (as of 11/9/15) -- coating engineer is working on trying to spec up a filter combo

    One option is double layer coating; first would be IR filter, then a thin sheet of glass, then broadband AR coating

    Pros: theoretically have the capacity to reject 1100+ wavelengths and combine with broadband AR layer for usable wavelengths; 

    Cons: Limited to 15"x8"

    (update 11/11/15) -- ios Optics can't do this; they would have to combine 260-450, 400-700, and 700-1100nm broadband AR coatings with a rejection band for 1100+, but this creates naturally occurring harmonics around the visible range. Still in contact with them because another they're working on a similar project and may have some suggestions for other companies to reach out to.

List of Sponsors to contact:

Avery Dennison (on Alex's advice) 

Honeywell (also for cooling)

Dow (for advice, they have a "contact a PV specialist" link)

Vampire Optical Coatings (http://www.v-coat.com, claim to have >99% light transmission for plastic lens)

SunCat

Gochermann Solar Technology

ios Optics

General Notes:

Theory:

http://www.telaztec.com/Resources/TelAztecMicrostructureIntroApr2008.pdf

        Introductory article to textured AR. 

http://www.popsci.com/technology/article/2010-05/glare-reducing-moth-eye-tech-promises-be-really-dull-good-way

    Cool Popsci article on textured AR, good introduction if you're not too clear on what's going here

https://www.rp-photonics.com/anti_reflection_coatings.html

    (see the section on gradient index coatings)

http://fdtd.kintechlab.com/en/ar

    This is a website with an explanation of the theory of textured anti-reflective surfaces; it's kinda complicated though, and may not be the best source to learn about this.

    It also has a C++ library for simulation 

http://schallenberg-optics.de/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/SPIE-8168-59-Schallenberg-Manuscript.pdf

    Has what looks like a decent treatment of textured AR theory; might be a better source than the Kintech Lab one. 

Manufacturing:

http://www.tekra.com/capabilities/plastic-film-coating/custom-coating-plastic-film

    A company that does custom coatings of plastic; may not be able to do textured anti-reflective surfaces though

http://www.google.com/patents/US20140182670

    Interesting patent by a company that's near us (Intermolecular). Could be a good source if we decide to manufacture ourselves.

http://www.telaztec.com/Resources/SID-ME-AutoDisplayOct04.pdf

    Interesting article on using textured AR in cars; Telaztec looks like a good company to look into

http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/713820946

    Scientific Article on the optical properties of moth-eye surfaces

http://www.researchgate.net/publication/51866179_Studying_nanostructured_nipple_arrays_of_moth_eye_facets_helps_to_design_better_thin_film_solar_cells

    Another scientific article on moth-eye surfaces, but focused on thin-film photovoltaics (PV)

http://www.researchgate.net/publication/234877337_Broadband_moth-eye_antireflection_coatings_fabricated_by_low-cost_nanoimprinting._Appl_Phys_Lett

    Yet another scientific article; this one focuses on manufacturing though. 

https://www.bnl.gov/newsroom/news.php?a=11685

Brookhaven national labs, uses moth-eye on silicon (etching process).
