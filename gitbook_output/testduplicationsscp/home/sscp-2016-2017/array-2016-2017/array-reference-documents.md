# SSCP - Array Reference Documents

# Array Reference Documents

A place for the keeping of good documents for new array team members or anyone who wants to know more about array stuff!

Solar Collector Specs for WSC 2017: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sFgUfNgaNjIuP98osQP_c0eic_lorpLFK8GCgH0zWEA/edit?usp=sharing.

Both "Instructions Manual" and "Module Sealing" come courtesy of Oliver Gochermann from when we bought his cells for this cycle. 

The SunPower Module Degradation White Paper is exactly what you think; I found the sections on UV degradation and moisture degradation to be interesting, but scanning it to see how cells degrade is never a bad idea. 

Kat Han's (SunPower engineer, former co-team lead for Oregon State) thesis on optical modeling is also in here; it uses a lot of jargon if I recall correctly, but is a great explanation of what anti-reflective textures are and how they're modeled. 

Quoted Efficiency/data for E60 bins; please do not share with people outside solar car. That will break our NDA and will have very bad consequences for the team in general and you in particular.
