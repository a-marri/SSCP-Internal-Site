## Array Reference Documents

A place for the keeping of good documents for new array team members or anyone who wants to know more about array stuff!

Solar Collector Specs for WSC 2017: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sFgUfNgaNjIuP98osQP\_c0eic\_lorpLFK8GCgH0zWEA/edit?usp=sharing.

Both "Instructions Manual" and "Module Sealing" come courtesy of Oliver Gochermann from when we bought his cells for this cycle.&#x20;

The SunPower Module Degradation White Paper is exactly what you think; I found the sections on UV degradation and moisture degradation to be interesting, but scanning it to see how cells degrade is never a bad idea.&#x20;

Kat Han's (SunPower engineer, former co-team lead for Oregon State) thesis on optical modeling is also in here; it uses a lot of jargon if I recall correctly, but is a great explanation of what anti-reflective textures are and how they're modeled.&#x20;

Quoted Efficiency/data for E60 bins; please do not share with people outside solar car. That will break our NDA and will have very bad consequences for the team in general and you in particular.
