# SSCP - Cooling

# Cooling

Meeting 1/23/17:

Exact wording of rule as of 1/23/17:

* External devices intended to increase the irradiance on the solar collector or increase the efficiency of the solar collector must not be used at any time. Ground sheets used when charging must not increase the irradiance on the solar collector.Spraying of water from external sources is no longer allowed 
* External devices intended to increase the irradiance on the solar collector or increase the efficiency of the solar collector must not be used at any time. Ground sheets used when charging must not increase the irradiance on the solar collector.Spraying of water from external sources is no longer allowed 
* Spraying of water from external sources is no longer allowed 

* External devices intended to increase the irradiance on the solar collector or increase the efficiency of the solar collector must not be used at any time. Ground sheets used when charging must not increase the irradiance on the solar collector.Spraying of water from external sources is no longer allowed 
* Spraying of water from external sources is no longer allowed

Spraying of water from external sources is no longer allowed 

Ideas:

1. Pour water instead of spraying it

    Use a funnel-type bracket, pump water into it and it releases a very fine sheet, very slowly

2. Heatsink idea:

    Heatsinks on the inside of the car so that we have cooling while the topshell is up.

Eric So- Liquid Metal Cooling

So one thing that I have found in regards to cooling is something that IBM has looked into. Basically what they do is have a very thin layer of liquid gallium-indium compound. It's liquid at room temperature and has a higher thermal conductivity and specific heat capacity that water. Because of that, the compound works really well as a liquid cooling material, I just don't know for sure if it can work as a passive cooling system or if it needs to be circulated. If it needs to be circulated then we would have to see how much energy would be required to do that. Keeping this here for reference, if I find anything else about it then I'll add to this.

Hey Cool people! To reiterate my earlier email, the goal for this week is to find 3-5 sponsors that we can email on Sunday. Since you guys are working on something that might be a bit harder to find sponsors for though, I'd probably shoot for 3 sponsors total. 

List of Possible Sponsors to Contact:

Honeywell (back sheet)

IBM 

Action Items:

Take a look at the old cooling page on the 14-15 page; it might have some interesting ideas.
