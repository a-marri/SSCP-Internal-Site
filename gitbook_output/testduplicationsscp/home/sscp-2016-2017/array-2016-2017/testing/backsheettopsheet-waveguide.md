## Backsheet/Topsheet Waveguide

Prof. McGeehee hypothesized that Arctan's backsheet diffusely reflected light, which was then internally reflected and still reached the solar cells. \[add link to discussion page here]

This was tested using a blue laser and single cell test coupon. The short circuit was measured with a 6.5 digit DMM.

Test setup:

Testing Setup

Results:

The short circuit current just outside the edge of the cell was 7-8% of the short circuit current. The current decreased to 1% at a distance of 6.0mm Â± 1mm.&#x20;

Reflectance off cell

Conclusions:

Increasing the spacing between cells on Arctan would increase the array power slighty. The aero trade-off and additional I^2R losses from additional tabbing are not considered.
