## List of Tests on Flash Tester

This page is for a list of tests that will be conducted using the flash tester (Sinton FMT-350). If you have an idea for a test, add it to the list! Once we finish the test, add a subpage to this one and link it under the tests entry in this list. Also, please make sure to label the cells you use, and record which cells were used in the page you make for the test.&#x20;

Encapsulation Stack Testing (ongoing)

&#x20;   Link:

&#x20;   Description: Testing different materials for cell encapsulation stack.&#x20;

Flash Tester Light Uniformity Test

&#x20;   Link:

&#x20;   Description: Use a reference photodetector to measure the light output of the flash unit. Confirm it is uniform to within specifications.

Flash Tester Light Intensity Test

&#x20;   Link:

&#x20;   Description: Use a reference photodetector to measure the light output of the flash unit at different power levels. Confirm it varies proportionally to the power setting.

Building Thermal Control Test

&#x20;   Link:

&#x20;   Description: Us the thermocouple logger over a 24 hour period to record temperature fluctuations in the test room.

Short-term Repeatability Test

&#x20;   Link:

&#x20;   Description: Take the same module. Mount it. Test it. Dismount it. Repeat many times and see how much the result varies.

Cell Binning Test

&#x20;   Link:

&#x20;   Description: Test all single-cell coupons to get IV curves, then figure out what the module-level losses would be due to cell mismatch.&#x20;

UV Degradation Testing

&#x20;   Link (once we get it):

&#x20;   Description: Test single-cell coupons (which ones?) before and after exposure to UV light in order to measure the effects of UV degradation on SunPower cells.&#x20;
