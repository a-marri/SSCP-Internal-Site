# SSCP - Cracked Cells Testing

# Cracked Cells Testing

This page is to document a mini-experiment run at SunPower using their single-cell flash tester (Sinton FCT-350 I think). In it, we tested cells before and after cracking them. It's worth noting that these cracks weren't miniature; they went across much of the cell and were made by bending the cell on the side of a table to around 70-90 degrees. However, it was only one crack, so it never took up too much surface area (meaning it wasn't a spiderweb crack; it was one solid line that was very definitely broken).

The files are all .mfr files, which is a proprietary file to Sinton as far as I can tell, so you would have to open this on a computer loaded with Sinton's software to do the full analysis, but my recollection is that it was a case of the shunt resistance decreasing, and the efficiency changed by about 0.3% total efficiency per crack. So, a 23.9% efficient cell would become around 23.6% efficienty
