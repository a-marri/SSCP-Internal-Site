## Optical Reflectance Testing

In order to build a better encapsulation, we need to understand the pure optical performance of previous encapsulations. George Burkhard in the McGeehee lab has been very helpful and has a measurement setup to measure reflectance vs angle vs wavelength.

The paper describing the underlying measurement technique is attached.&#x20;
