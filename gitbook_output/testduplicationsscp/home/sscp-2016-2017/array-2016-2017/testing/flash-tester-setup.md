Attached Document FMT-350_Information.pdf is very useful.

Calibration

Based on testing, whenever you move the module in question, you have to recalibrate. When you do so, you actually get fairly consistent results (~+-0.1%). Moving alligator clips does significantly affect the series resistance of the module; we moved from ~3 to ~2.6 Ω/cm^2 just by moving the clips closer to the cell. This resulted in an increase of ~0.4% absolute efficiency  (~18.7% -> ~19.2%) of the 2-cell module, which is fairly significant. We will definitely have to be careful to try and attach the contacts the same way each time we measure different modules. Full data is on the Sinton computer, and will hopefully be uploaded to some sort of external server. 

Also, day-to-day, our average today was much lower than the last time we tested :( So, we need to figure out how to make that consistent, which we will probably need to look over data to do. 

Baffle setup is complete! 

We cut a 10" x 15" hole centered on the flash tester in the curtains. Since our module is around 20"x30", and the baffles are 92" away from the flash tester and 82" away from the module, we went with approximately half so that we'd have some wiggle room on where we put the flash tester. 

Things still to do:

1. Cover back wall

2. Cover floor area of baffles

3. Get clips for baffles

4. Possibly get paint

5. Cover ceiling area of baffles.

(below is saved for future reference)

Baffles:

1. Measure height/width of room, stitch ThorLabs curtains together to match height/width

2. Measure relative height of flash tester and module holder

3. Calculate Aperture Size

4. Cut out Aperture

5. Hang Baffles from ceiling hooks

To Do:

    Measure Dimensions of curtained area -- just over 10' tall, ~5' wide with curtains closed, just under 5m long total. 

    Build PVC Pipes -- not going to do this now

    Stich Cloth together -- done by Maggie and Max Wang!

    Cut Aperture

    Hang onto ceiling -- via ceiling hooks

    Buy Paint
