# SSCP - Binning Data 2017

# Binning Data 2017

We decided to test each of our cells before using them this cycle in order to sub-bin our cells -- we heard there was a lot of variation among the cells in bin M, so we wanted to see if it was true (and if true, whether we could get gains from it). 

From our initial testing, we found standard deviations of 0.18% efficiency and 0.006 A I_sc (see binning data v1.xlsx). These were significant enough to convince us to bin our cells, so we went ahead and did it!

Calculating how big an upgrade that was is actually decently difficult and is something I would highly recommend the next team do -- it would be interesting to see how much this benefits us vs other things we do. 

Also, I'm missing the 4th/5th visit, which may have been done by someone else. 

Big Trends:

We binned based off I_sc eventually, so we can't really talk about the efficiencies of the cells for later rounds. But, from what we saw it definitely looked like the first batch of cells (which had been open to the air for a while) was actually definitively worse than other boxes that we opened later. 

From talking to SunPower people and others, I think it's definitely a good idea to find an airtight way to store our cells in a dark, dry location -- preferably with plenty of desiccant in there as well. Storing the cells is something we haven't given much thought to before, and I think we could definitely improve there.
