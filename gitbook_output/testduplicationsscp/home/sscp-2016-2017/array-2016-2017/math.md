Cooling:

The goal of array cooling is based on the decrease in performance of silicon solar cells at elevated temperatures. SSCP uses Sunpower cells, with the C60 temperature dependence stated as -0.32% / °C above 25 °C. Test drive tests have shown that the forced convection during driving brings the array temperature close to ambient, but during control stops the temperature increases well beyond. The highest measured was 55°C in Central Valley testing (with ambient temperatures around 25-30°C), but that was a lower temperature than Australia driving, where it is believed that the modules heat up to 65-70°C.  Using a conservative estimate of the 20°C increase, performance can decrease by as much as 6.4% relative, which equates to 1.5% absolute assuming the Bin Ms perform at 24%. Based on the 4 square meters of cell area allotted and 1000W/m^2, cooling by 20°C could save more than 60W during control stops.&#x20;

There are two possible thermal models for understanding the thermal characteristics of the modules. The simplified thermal calculation method is based on estimating the specific heat of encapsulated array and using experimental data regarding elevated temperature to determine how much heat needs to be removed. The mass of an encapsulated cell is around 35g and there are 260 cells, for a total mass of around 9 kg.  The typical specific heat of a polymer is slightly above 1kJ/kgC (1.03kJ/kgC for PET, 1.25 for PVDF, 1.4 EVA, and 1-1.5 polyolefin) and the specific heat of silicon is slightly below 1kJ/kgC (0.7 kJ/kgC), so the encapsulation is assumed to have a specific heat of around 1kJ/kgC. Thus, if the array temperature is elevated by 20°C, then 20°&#x43;_&#x39;k&#x67;_&#x31;kJ/kg°C = 180kJ. Thus to decrease the temperature of the array, 180kJ heat would need to be removed.&#x20;

The more advanced model calculates the impact of radiative heat loss, convection, and electrical energy conversion terms. Conduction without an engineering cooling mechanism is considered negligible, and is the term that would be added given the addition of a cooling system.&#x20;

One solution to this problem is using a dry ice heat sink. The dry ice provides significant cooling power from a high heat of sublimation, as well as the specific heat over the temperature gradient for the cooled gas that remains in the container before being released.&#x20;

Dry ice heat of sublimation: 570kJ/kg

Dry ice average specific heat: \~2kJ/kg

Heat capacity per (2kJ/k&#x67;_&#x4B;)_(348K-194K) + (570kJ/kg) = 878 kJ/kg

This represents that absolute maximum cooling power, so assuming all of the gas does not cool before being released, it will be estimated around 800 kJ/kg.&#x20;
