# SSCP - Meeting 2/18/16

# Meeting 2/18/16

TLDR!

1) We are going to get more information from Chuzel and Gocherman regarding order deadlines and testing advice (which they have both offered).  

2) We will continue to secure encapsulation materials for our pipeline in the spring.

3) An alum from Michigan State may help us put together a device that allows us to easily encapsulate cells.

Soldering:

    63-37 (utactic?)

    Lead-free isn't great. (silver)

    best solder is lead-tin-copper-silver

        2%silver, 1%copper. 

    2-3 seconds for solder joint, let it cool

    no sharp points on the top.

    

Encapsulation

    Laminator is optimal

    Aluminum plates with vacuum seal could work

    Resistance heater could also work. 

Alain Chuzel:

    Should we encapsulate with him?

        How much can he improve on us vs how much would it cost. 

    What is his technology?

        Fiberglass texturing?!

            Military grade fiberglass with high transmittance

        Encapsulant thingy

    

To Do:

    Chuzel: Kelsey will continue talking, figure out important dates

    Gochermann: Alex will talk, ask about testing, FEP vs ETFE, etc. 

    Pursue materials obtainment

    Microstructures too

    Dupont would be awesome

    Willow Glass -- Abrisa

    Laminating system: work on getting one donated

        Or get Steve's system working

    Solmetric (John)

    Email companies from conference: John
