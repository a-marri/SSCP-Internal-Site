## Meeting 2/18/16

TLDR!

1. We are going to get more information from Chuzel and Gocherman regarding order deadlines and testing advice (which they have both offered). &#x20;
2. We will continue to secure encapsulation materials for our pipeline in the spring.
3. An alum from Michigan State may help us put together a device that allows us to easily encapsulate cells.

Soldering:

&#x20;   63-37 (utactic?)

&#x20;   Lead-free isn't great. (silver)

&#x20;   best solder is lead-tin-copper-silver

&#x20;       2%silver, 1%copper.&#x20;

&#x20;   2-3 seconds for solder joint, let it cool

&#x20;   no sharp points on the top.

&#x20;  &#x20;

Encapsulation

&#x20;   Laminator is optimal

&#x20;   Aluminum plates with vacuum seal could work

&#x20;   Resistance heater could also work.&#x20;

Alain Chuzel:

&#x20;   Should we encapsulate with him?

&#x20;       How much can he improve on us vs how much would it cost.&#x20;

&#x20;   What is his technology?

&#x20;       Fiberglass texturing?!

&#x20;           Military grade fiberglass with high transmittance

&#x20;       Encapsulant thingy

&#x20;  &#x20;

To Do:

&#x20;   Chuzel: Kelsey will continue talking, figure out important dates

&#x20;   Gochermann: Alex will talk, ask about testing, FEP vs ETFE, etc.&#x20;

&#x20;   Pursue materials obtainment

&#x20;   Microstructures too

&#x20;   Dupont would be awesome

&#x20;   Willow Glass -- Abrisa

&#x20;   Laminating system: work on getting one donated

&#x20;       Or get Steve's system working

&#x20;   Solmetric (John)

&#x20;   Email companies from conference: John
