* Alta Devices ContractSend tonight:Hi Ben, Here is an outline of our agreement. If you would like this agreement in a more official format please let us know, but if this works for Alta Devices, it works for the Stanford Solar Car Project. Stanford Solar Car Sponsorship AgreementDelivery of Test Modules: July 2016 (Please advise on earliest possible delivery date)Number of Cells: ~100 cells in two test module strings with best optical encapsulation by Alta Devices (These can be one of the standard sizes you showed us during our meeting)Value: $2,000+Tier: Bronze Entitled to: Bronze benefits from attached sponsor documentAlta Devices and the Stanford Solar Car Project will move forward with a full array if test data shows at least 27.3% module efficiency, no unusual loses from clouding, and good optical performance at angles. If you already have data on these metrics, please let us know, as it could accelerate the process. 3.56 sq m (ideally 2x for backup array) Array Delivery: Winter 2017 (Please advise on the earliest possible delivery date)Number of Cells for that area: 3,560-7,120+Value: $71,200-142,000+ Tier: PlatinumEntitled to: platinum benefits from attached sponsor docBen, if it is asking too much to have two full arrays, we can make do with one. If the second needs to be supplied at a later date, as a partial backup, or not at all, we don't want that to be a reason that you can't sponsor SSCP. Also, please note that as a platinum-level sponsor, additional negotiated benefits are also available. Let us know what else you'd like from the Stanford Solar Car Project to show our appreciation and we can work with you to make sure AltaDevices gets as much out of supporting us as possible!Rather than getting a base cell, we should start with their best encapsulation -- may not need to/want to encapsulate them ourselvesOutdoor test: power as a function of timeGaAs vs Si -- if this is to decide which to use, we just need to compare themCompare Alta to GochermannHow will we make this decision?

* Hi Ben, 
* Here is an outline of our agreement. If you would like this agreement in a more official format please let us know, but if this works for Alta Devices, it works for the Stanford Solar Car Project. 
* Stanford Solar Car Sponsorship AgreementDelivery of Test Modules: July 2016 (Please advise on earliest possible delivery date)Number of Cells: ~100 cells in two test module strings with best optical encapsulation by Alta Devices (These can be one of the standard sizes you showed us during our meeting)Value: $2,000+Tier: Bronze Entitled to: Bronze benefits from attached sponsor documentAlta Devices and the Stanford Solar Car Project will move forward with a full array if test data shows at least 27.3% module efficiency, no unusual loses from clouding, and good optical performance at angles. If you already have data on these metrics, please let us know, as it could accelerate the process. 3.56 sq m (ideally 2x for backup array) Array Delivery: Winter 2017 (Please advise on the earliest possible delivery date)Number of Cells for that area: 3,560-7,120+Value: $71,200-142,000+ Tier: PlatinumEntitled to: platinum benefits from attached sponsor docBen, if it is asking too much to have two full arrays, we can make do with one. If the second needs to be supplied at a later date, as a partial backup, or not at all, we don't want that to be a reason that you can't sponsor SSCP. Also, please note that as a platinum-level sponsor, additional negotiated benefits are also available. Let us know what else you'd like from the Stanford Solar Car Project to show our appreciation and we can work with you to make sure AltaDevices gets as much out of supporting us as possible!

Rather than getting a base cell, we should start with their best encapsulation -- may not need to/want to encapsulate them ourselves

Outdoor test: power as a function of time

* GaAs vs Si -- if this is to decide which to use, we just need to compare them
* Compare Alta to Gochermann
* How will we make this decision?
