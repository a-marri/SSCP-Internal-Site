## Weekly Planning

Week of October 10th:

Where we are right now: Our testing suggests that the encapsulation stack doesn't matter significantly compared to texturing because we've already optimized the encapsulation stack pretty well. So, further testing will focus on finishing up encapsulation stack testing (ionomer and Fluon ETFE have to be tested) and then mostly on dicing and texturing. Also, we need to get the outdoor tester set up!

To Do this week:

2 Ionomer encapsulations

2 ETFE encapsulations

Get outdoor tester set up for relative comparison between Gochermann and F3K encapsulation stack with bin M

EL Test the Gochermann module for Logan to verify cracks

Verify power loss due to dicing from A-Laser (go to SunPower for this).&#x20;
