# SSCP - Building circuit boards

# Building circuit boards

* Oshpark - foreign production, batch service, very reasonable for 2-layer boards and decent for 4-layer boards.
* Sierra Circuits - local, high-quality, expensive. Have sponsored SSCP in the past.Advanced Circuits - domestic, high-quality, expensive. Have sponsored SSCP in the past.Streamline - local, high-quality, board-only. Better for large-run stuff.SF Circuits - aggregation service that can do stuff slow-and-cheap or fast-and-not-hideously-expensive. Can also do assembly.Macrofab - domestic turn-key (board+assembly) which gives discounts for using parts from their library. High-quality PCB, low-quality silkscreen. Excellent customer service and reasonable pricing.pcb:ng - domestic turn-key service. Haven't tried it, but some Googlers really like it.Screaming Circuits - partnered with Advanced Circuits. Haven't tried them.Small Batch Assembly - pretty much all in the name. They don't make boards, but they do populate them.
