# Power Supplies

Our main power supply is the Soresnsen XPF60-10DP.

It has two ports, each of which go to 60V and can carry up to 10A.

This particular supply has a 7-Week Lead Time, so make sure you order one ahead of time if you're going to break one!

Note, if you turn it on and both ports say FAIL 4, then all you have to do is turn it off for about one-to-ten minutes and turn it back on. The reason being, the FAIL4 is the Forced Update State, during which you're unable to output power. There is more information in the firmware.zip attached.
