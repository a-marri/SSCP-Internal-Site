## Pick-And-Place PCB Assembly Options

We are looking into Pick-And-Place PCB assembly for reliability and manufacturing speed this cycle.

Options:

PCBUnlimited - company based in Oregon who is interested in sponsoring us, see attached email thread.

[PCBUnlimited](http://www.pcbunlimited.com/)

Sierra Circuits - an already-existing PCB printing sponsor who also does assembly. Sasha: local, high-quality, expensive. Have sponsored SSCP in the past.

Macrofab - they accept ODB++ files from Altium, Max Praglin used for new DC-DC converter. Sasha: domestic turn-key (board+assembly) which gives discounts for using parts from their library. High-quality PCB, low-quality&#x20;

CircuitHub - option, don't know much about them.  Ben Stabler recommended.

Oshpark - foreign production, batch service, very reasonable for 2-layer boards and decent for 4-layer boards.

Advanced Circuits - domestic, high-quality, expensive. Have sponsored SSCP in the past.

Streamline - local, high-quality, board-only. Better for large-run stuff.

SF Circuits - aggregation service that can do stuff slow-and-cheap or fast-and-not-hideously-expensive. Can also do assembly.

pcb:ng - domestic turn-key service. Haven't tried it, but some Googlers really like it.

Screaming Circuits - partnered with Advanced Circuits. Haven't tried them.

Small Batch Assembly - pretty much all in the name. They don't make boards, but they do populate them.
