1. Mold quote attached (HDT 350F, ~70k).  Need to verify that materials are up to par.

Mold quote attached (HDT 350F, ~70k).  Need to verify that materials are up to par.

From Christensen:

"The quote based on last year’s model but using an acrylic urethane lamination system.

The 350F temp is right at the maximum level for this material but because of your very limited production requirements and the fact the next level of material would be to go to a very expensive epoxy system I feel that this is the best direct to go in.

Take a look and if you have any further questions just let me know."

1. See attached quote for low temp vinyl-ester mold (HDT 270F, ~$50k).
2. See attached quote for high temp epoxy/e-glass molds. (HDT 350F, ~$65k).  Too good to be true?
