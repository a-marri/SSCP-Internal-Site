# Call with Jamie 3/19

* base layup one core one

- everywhere

- (what we did if no reason not to)

- 90 degree with 1/8 inch core between

- tail, top shell, fairings

* two core two anywhere might trim

- stiffer, won't shatter

- square connecting the wheels

- one of the plys was 45 degree

- improve load transfer diagonally

- no real analysis, but probably a good call

* top and bottom shell: unidirectional tape

- two long longitudinal strips the length of chassis panels

- two strips connecting the wheels

- strip on either side of the core

* tail was solid laminate

        - gets very thin

        - taper the core, go to 6 plys, then sand to get very fine edge

* trailing edge of fairings

        - pour in West Systems microbubbles?

        - make a straw out of uni?

        - wouldn't be structural no matter what

* SpaceX presentation should include everything

         - everything correct but 45 degree ply should go across the middle

         - stack in bottom right corner = center section

         - uni in the driver compartment

* Jamie was very wary of trimming core -- not actually a concern

        - put core everywhere

                - FlexCore can do 3D curvature

* access panels are now different

        - have to rely on core in the middle

--> put uni in the mold in a 6-inch section with heater blanket and see if its what we want (should try before putting on a full part)

* fiberglass

        - anything that needs to be radiotransparent

        - fairing: tricky

        - going to have to be more than last time --> our current fiberglass is very thin

        - bubble was 5 layers no core

                - probably overkill

        - Jamie doesn't think current plan to match carbon thickness is necessary

                - add FlexCore and do 2 core 2

        - bridge over the top of the bubble

                - basically 1D curve

                - add core

* sealing/polishing

        - extreme cleaning amounted to polishing

        - go with what the manufacturer recommends
