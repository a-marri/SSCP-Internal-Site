## Call with Jamie 3/19

* base layup one core one
* everywhere
* (what we did if no reason not to)
* 90 degree with 1/8 inch core between
* tail, top shell, fairings
* two core two anywhere might trim
* stiffer, won't shatter
* square connecting the wheels
* one of the plys was 45 degree
* improve load transfer diagonally
* no real analysis, but probably a good call
* top and bottom shell: unidirectional tape
* two long longitudinal strips the length of chassis panels
* two strips connecting the wheels
* strip on either side of the core
* tail was solid laminate

&#x20;       \- gets very thin

&#x20;       \- taper the core, go to 6 plys, then sand to get very fine edge

* trailing edge of fairings

&#x20;       \- pour in West Systems microbubbles?

&#x20;       \- make a straw out of uni?

&#x20;       \- wouldn't be structural no matter what

* SpaceX presentation should include everything

&#x20;        \- everything correct but 45 degree ply should go across the middle

&#x20;        \- stack in bottom right corner = center section

&#x20;        \- uni in the driver compartment

* Jamie was very wary of trimming core -- not actually a concern

&#x20;       \- put core everywhere

&#x20;               \- FlexCore can do 3D curvature

* access panels are now different

&#x20;       \- have to rely on core in the middle

\--> put uni in the mold in a 6-inch section with heater blanket and see if its what we want (should try before putting on a full part)

* fiberglass

&#x20;       \- anything that needs to be radiotransparent

&#x20;       \- fairing: tricky

&#x20;       \- going to have to be more than last time --> our current fiberglass is very thin

&#x20;       \- bubble was 5 layers no core

&#x20;               \- probably overkill

&#x20;       \- Jamie doesn't think current plan to match carbon thickness is necessary

&#x20;               \- add FlexCore and do 2 core 2

&#x20;       \- bridge over the top of the bubble

&#x20;               \- basically 1D curve

&#x20;               \- add core

* sealing/polishing

&#x20;       \- extreme cleaning amounted to polishing

&#x20;       \- go with what the manufacturer recommends
