# SSCP - Carbon Fiber Roll Cage

# Carbon Fiber Roll Cage

Meeting Notes from March 16th, 2016

ESE:

1. $46,000 -- design help, consultation, and construction
2. Too expensive

$46,000 -- design help, consultation, and construction

Too expensive

Overall:

1. Roll cage is the easiest way to lose weight -- carbon fiber vs aluminumWeight is not the biggest dealWeight distribution, on the other hand, is a huge dealAssuming the same asymmetrical design, this removes weight from the right place
2. Weight is not the biggest deal
3. Weight distribution, on the other hand, is a huge dealAssuming the same asymmetrical design, this removes weight from the right place
4. Assuming the same asymmetrical design, this removes weight from the right place
5. FEA -- not that hard

FEA -- not that hard

* The hard part is actually fabricating the roll cageHiring professionals would make this not an issueContingent on getting manufacturedNeed to put together a list of companies that might be able to do thisContact as many as we can

Spring quarter:

1. Determine what software to use
2. Practice designing something, and do FEA on some carbon layup
3. Learn to use the software in general
