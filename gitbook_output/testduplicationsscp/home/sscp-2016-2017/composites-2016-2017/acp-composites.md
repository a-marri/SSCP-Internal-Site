Hello Max,

 

I apologize for not getting back to you sooner, as it has been very busy around here lately.

 

Glad to hear that things are coming along and I think we should be in a good position to accommodate your requests, given the timeframe and requirements thus far.

 

Can you please send me a technical data sheet on the carbon fiber material that you would like us to plycut?

 

Also for Plycutting, we have a nesting software that we can use to help get the best yield out of your source material. Please send .DXF files of the individual pieces to be cut and we will do the nesting to tell you total material requirements per kit.

 

I just verified our oven size and it should easily accommodate your parts at 4m x 1.5m, and if we rack them appropriately… we could possibly cure both in one shot. Yes, our oven will handle 350 deg F for curing.

 

We will need to get a more specific date to ensure we reserve time on the plycutter and oven, but we don’t need to lock that down until we get much closer to the actual time.

 

Please let me know if you have any other questions and once we get a little more info from you, we will provide an estimate for machine time/labor with an educational discount for you.

 

Thanks and look forward to hearing from you.

 

Peter Nusser
