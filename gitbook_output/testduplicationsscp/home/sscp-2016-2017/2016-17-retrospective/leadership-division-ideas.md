Leadership structure proposal

I propose doing away with the "team lead" position and replacing the extant leadership structure with the following three roles, in no particular order:

1) logistics

    How can we keep Stanford and WSC happy? (liasing)

    How can we afford to do what we're doing? (fundraising)

    How do we get everything we need to Australia? (regulations)

    If people are in conflict, how can we remedy that? (personnel)

    If we need to outsource something, what is the best place and way to do that?

2) engineering

    Are we meeting all of the WSC regulations?

    Have we forgotten any details, like how this component will be used or what it should be made out of?

    Is anyone overworked, and if so, how do we allocate more resources to them?

    What should we make in house versus outsource on a purely "best for the car" basis?

    Are all of the subteams on track and meeting deadlines?

3) manufacturing & integration

    Can we actually make this part we hope to make ourselves? If not, can we find someone to manufacture it?

    Are any components (either within or between subteams) in conflict with each other?

    How can we make the process of manufacturing some component easier/faster/less prone to error?

In most cases, the three would be on equal footing for decision making. However, occasionally the logistics person would have to make a final call, because the only problems we cannot creatively engineer our way out of are financial and regulatory -- if it is not legally possible or if we cannot get the funds or in-kind resources to do something, that is the only time we definitively cannot do it.

An example of how these three positions would work together from this past cycle:

Array

Engineering lead: Have we made sure the array fits the aerobody? Did we correctly do math to be sure we are using as much area as possible but not more than allowed? Have we done the necessary tests to be sure the encapsulation stack we've selected makes sense? If we need to do more tests, when and who will do them and how will we evaluate the results? Which permutations of stringing have we tried? Is electrical team aware of and involved in decisions about how things will be wired? 

Manufacturing & integration lead: Is it physically possible to manufacture modules the size we've designed with the resources we have (table size, oven size, people, etc)? What is the ideal process to manufacture modules with the encapsulation we have? Do the seams between modules mess up aero, and if so how can we modify them to avoid this? Will the wiring conflict with the chassis and if so, how do we avoid that? Will the wires have to bend too tightly and how do we avoid that? 

Logistics lead: Do we need more MPPTs, cells, or encapsulation materials? If we get a lot of materials, where do we store them until we use them? If we need to use an oven besides the one we have, how do we get permission/access to it? Do we have all of the correct documentation for WSC?

(I chose array here because I think the array team internally did a fantastic job considering all of these questions and addressing them, but I think they and all subteams would have benefited from leadership prompting and double checking in all of these areas)

There are clear overlaps between these questions for each position, but they also have distinct primary concerns. Engineering focuses on whether the design is a good one, manufacturing/integration on whether and how it can be implemented, and logistics on how we can get materials, money, and permission to do what we need to do. All three need to be involved in engineering decisions, and I think it's super important that all three be separate people so we can creatively attack problems and be more thorough.

About 2/3 of the way through the cycle, Gawan began filling the manufacturing/integration role and we stopped having Kelsey + Max discussions in favor of Kelsey + Max + Gawan decisions. This change improved things, but happened way too late in the cycle. Adding someone who considers manufacturability from the beginning would go a very long way towards avoiding most of the problems we encountered this cycle, since integration issues were what really set us back.

A formal manufacturing & integration person who did their job well could have prevented the panics during composites week (running out of materials because no one double checked the inventory), the suspension/chassis interference we discovered just before unveiling, the bubble not fitting and needing to be remanufactured, the canopy hinging problem, the extreme challenge with baking the big module, wiring not actually fitting in the chassis holes, etc.
