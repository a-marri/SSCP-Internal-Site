Leadership

While serving as SSCP's Engineering Director over these past two years I have developed a lot of opinions about leadership and team dynamics.  Some of these are distilled into the points below.  I hope that these thoughts help you build an exuberant team that is capable of achieving its goals.

Consensus Building is Not Democracy

When making a major decision, it is tempting to take a survey and go with the most popular option.  However, this is often not the best decision for the car or the team in the long term.  If you are a leader of the team, it is your responsibility to do your homework in order to understand the options and to be able to convince others why the decision that you eventually make is the best decision.

Hear from everyone, not to gauge sentiment, but to better understand the pros and cons of a given decision.  People may like you in the short term if you mindlessly do what they think is best.  But people will respect you in the long term for showing them how your final decision, even if it differs from theirs, better achieves their ultimate goal.

Credibility is Your Greatest Asset

If you are telling people that they need to do something because you are their boss and they need to listen to you, you are bad leader.  Instead, be a person that people want to listen to because they respect you.  Develop credibility by getting important things done when you say you will and taking the time to learn the skills that you need to solve difficult tasks at hand.  As a leader, a failure to produce or follow through has negative implications that reach beyond the immediate responsibility in question.&#x20;

Be Honest with Yourself About Other People's Strengths

When you work with somebody for just a short amount of time, you quickly develop an intuition of their work habits, their ability to learn on their own, and their capacity to follow through.  Trust this intuition.  Sometimes it is tempting to defer a responsibility to someone else because they are your friend or because they hold a certain title within the organization, even though you know that it will not be a good fit.  Find someone else that is better suited.

Separate Personal From Professional

Sometimes you will need to disagree with other people on the team.  Maybe it has to do with some design decision or timeline issue or whatever.  These people are your friends and it does not feel good to disagree with them, even if it might be necessary for the good of the team.  Just keep the discussion factual and focused on solving the problem at hand.  The leaders I have looked up to in this organization remain friends with everyone despite freely speaking their mind.

Foster A Healthy Social Environment

For almost everyone, having friendships with passionate teammates is a core motivator.  Hold social events or grab meals outside of the shop once in a while.  Solar car will give you the chance to connect with people you might otherwise never have the chance to meet.  It is fun to build cool things and even more fun to do it with friends.

Find Ways to Refresh Your Perspective

When you become immersed in a project for a long period of time, you can grow complacent with things that really need to change.  At Pixar the directors of every movie in development have regular meetings with an internal group called the _Braintrust_.  The _Braintrust_ gives candid feedback on the developing storyline and other recent creative choices.  The president of Pixar, Ed Catmull, thinks that even veteran movie directors tend to grow numb to the ideas that flow through their minds 24/7.  As a result, they lose their ability to differentiate good choices from bad.

Holding design reviews, meeting with individual alumni, connecting with other solar car teams, seeking out professors on campus, and visiting relevant engineering companies are all ways of refreshing your perspective.  Sometimes you just need a wake-up call.  You do not always need to seek more information, just someone to help you see what you already have in front of you in a different way.

Conclusion

This past cycle we were motivated by the idea that the car we were building would be better than the one we built last time.  I hope that the next team and the teams that follow continue to strive to be the best that SSCP has ever seen.  This attitude will help our organization remain an elite group on campus, and a strong competitor in the races to come.

I am always happy to discuss any team-related topics that you might want to chat about.  My email is maxdrach@gmail.com.
