# SSCP - Lessons Learned

# Lessons Learned

There were way too many things we learned throughout the cycle to document all of them here, and I think Max did an excellent job calling out high-level things, but here's a list of some things we didn't think about thoroughly enough or learn until too late:

* Manufacturing/outsourcing:Suppliers WILL screw up. Don't count on things being done on time, even if you're using a manufacturer who's been reliable three times before or have guaranteed next day shipping on Amazon that's alway on time.Budget enough to make each outsourced part twice in case it's wrong, lost, or damaged. This happened a lot.If a company is doing something as a sponsorship they will not prioritize you. Don't expect them to.Don't be afraid to pick up a phone and be annoying. Most manufacturers want you to use their online portal or email, but if you can find a person to talk to you will get helped faster. This is common sense but can be hard when they sound so angry to have you calling.If all else fails, drive to their shop and breathe down their necks.Read reviews of the places you're working with, or, better yet, only outsource to companies that you have a real reason to believe do good work. A one star review on google for a paint shop should've tipped us off that they would be a disaster, but they seemed nice and excited to work with us...Build quality continues to be an issue. Attention to detail is hard to maintain over the long process of building a solar car, especially when we don't have time/materials to do many practice runs of things, but the solidness, crispness, and niceness of the top couple teams mean they have a better chance of doing well.Don't assume your wonderful aero numbers will manifest in your car. Bondo, paint, layup derps, etc all take your finished product away from the goal. Remember that making something look nice should be secondary to matching the design, since we know what the design's aero performance is but we don't know what the similar "nicer" look has for drag numbers.Differences between Sundae and previous cars:Having two topshells is a lot more work than one. Make sure you have enough supplies, people, and time to do both of them well!With one configuration for the car, all driving could theoretically count towards race strategy characterization. With two topshells, only the driving with the topshell you race with counts, and you'll probably be tempted to use your race topshell as little as possible to protect it. We did this, and it bit us in the ass. Don't make this mistake.There's a lot we can still do better with topshells overall -- I think everyone who went on the race and saw the other teams has tons of new ideas about how to improve this.Our suspension design was ambitious and ultimately successful, but because it was so different it took a LOT more time to design and a LOT more money to make. Consider what your designs change in your timelines and budget.Team dynamics:People like being listened to, but when it comes down to it they need to understand that not all opinions can be followed. Team lead/engineering lead/subteam leads should habituate people to the pattern of listening and then making an individual decision early so that it's not a conflict point later on.On the race, make sure it's super clear what's expected of people. A lot of people on the race crew may not have a lot going on many days, but they should feel included in the decisions and challenges and empowered to help. We didn't have a lot of problems with this, but there were a few people who felt extraneous. Everyone is there for a reason, make sure people know that!Solar car van, machine shop, tools, etc and race crew rental cars, computers, etc are team supplies and no one can treat them like their own personal things. It's likely team members can borrow them sometimes, and it'll be obvious to everyone in retrospect that team stuff takes priority, but it merits pointing out.Not everyone gets along, and not everyone has to. But everyone needs to respect each other, and that goes in all directions.Keep people fed and they will be happier. Give people opportunity to sleep enough and they will be better engineers and also happier. Make sure people have enough water and they will be more effective.Don't let perfect be the enemy of good enough. There will come a time when you just need to finish and it won't be perfect but that's ok.Apply Occam's Razor to design: the simplest thing is probably the best. Look at Nuon. So simple and clean. Don't be tempted by all the cool things you could do -- go for the simplest design that gets the job done.Stanford & WSC relationships:VAIL staff can make or break the team.Try to appease them as much as possible early in the cycle so you have some cred with them later when you need to take up tons of space and make a mess. I sort of did this, but not as much as I maybe could have.Tell Larry/Stephen/Adele/Erina/etc really early what space you'll need and when. Explain why. Discuss solutions. But don't back down.Stanford finances people are a pain in the ass and honestly don't understand the team that well. Go over their head if you have to. Unless they get much more knowledgeable about exchange rates and the style of receipts in Australia (which they don't think are acceptable documentation), you probably will.WSC likes teams that communicate with them. Play their silly games on social media, jump through their hoops, and they'll be nicer to you.WSC enforced regulations much more strictly this cycle than last cycle. It's no longer a safe idea to count on them being lax with the rules. But do be ready to argue!Dealing with Stanford and WSC people will take up a lot more time than you think it will. Whoever is tasked with this -- team lead, business lead, someone else -- should be consistent in their approach and quick to respond to emails, and willing to sit through meetings that don't seem to accomplish much. And smile!

Manufacturing/outsourcing:

* Suppliers WILL screw up. Don't count on things being done on time, even if you're using a manufacturer who's been reliable three times before or have guaranteed next day shipping on Amazon that's alway on time.
* Budget enough to make each outsourced part twice in case it's wrong, lost, or damaged. This happened a lot.
* If a company is doing something as a sponsorship they will not prioritize you. Don't expect them to.
* Don't be afraid to pick up a phone and be annoying. Most manufacturers want you to use their online portal or email, but if you can find a person to talk to you will get helped faster. This is common sense but can be hard when they sound so angry to have you calling.
* If all else fails, drive to their shop and breathe down their necks.
* Read reviews of the places you're working with, or, better yet, only outsource to companies that you have a real reason to believe do good work. A one star review on google for a paint shop should've tipped us off that they would be a disaster, but they seemed nice and excited to work with us...
* Build quality continues to be an issue. Attention to detail is hard to maintain over the long process of building a solar car, especially when we don't have time/materials to do many practice runs of things, but the solidness, crispness, and niceness of the top couple teams mean they have a better chance of doing well.
* Don't assume your wonderful aero numbers will manifest in your car. Bondo, paint, layup derps, etc all take your finished product away from the goal. Remember that making something look nice should be secondary to matching the design, since we know what the design's aero performance is but we don't know what the similar "nicer" look has for drag numbers.

Differences between Sundae and previous cars:

* Having two topshells is a lot more work than one. Make sure you have enough supplies, people, and time to do both of them well!
* With one configuration for the car, all driving could theoretically count towards race strategy characterization. With two topshells, only the driving with the topshell you race with counts, and you'll probably be tempted to use your race topshell as little as possible to protect it. We did this, and it bit us in the ass. Don't make this mistake.
* There's a lot we can still do better with topshells overall -- I think everyone who went on the race and saw the other teams has tons of new ideas about how to improve this.
* Our suspension design was ambitious and ultimately successful, but because it was so different it took a LOT more time to design and a LOT more money to make. Consider what your designs change in your timelines and budget.

Team dynamics:

* People like being listened to, but when it comes down to it they need to understand that not all opinions can be followed. Team lead/engineering lead/subteam leads should habituate people to the pattern of listening and then making an individual decision early so that it's not a conflict point later on.
* On the race, make sure it's super clear what's expected of people. A lot of people on the race crew may not have a lot going on many days, but they should feel included in the decisions and challenges and empowered to help. We didn't have a lot of problems with this, but there were a few people who felt extraneous. Everyone is there for a reason, make sure people know that!
* Solar car van, machine shop, tools, etc and race crew rental cars, computers, etc are team supplies and no one can treat them like their own personal things. It's likely team members can borrow them sometimes, and it'll be obvious to everyone in retrospect that team stuff takes priority, but it merits pointing out.
* Not everyone gets along, and not everyone has to. But everyone needs to respect each other, and that goes in all directions.
* Keep people fed and they will be happier. Give people opportunity to sleep enough and they will be better engineers and also happier. Make sure people have enough water and they will be more effective.
* Don't let perfect be the enemy of good enough. There will come a time when you just need to finish and it won't be perfect but that's ok.
* Apply Occam's Razor to design: the simplest thing is probably the best. Look at Nuon. So simple and clean. Don't be tempted by all the cool things you could do -- go for the simplest design that gets the job done.

People like being listened to, but when it comes down to it they need to understand that not all opinions can be followed. Team lead/engineering lead/subteam leads should habituate people to the pattern of listening and then making an individual decision early so that it's not a conflict point later on.

Stanford & WSC relationships:

* VAIL staff can make or break the team.Try to appease them as much as possible early in the cycle so you have some cred with them later when you need to take up tons of space and make a mess. I sort of did this, but not as much as I maybe could have.Tell Larry/Stephen/Adele/Erina/etc really early what space you'll need and when. Explain why. Discuss solutions. But don't back down.

* Stanford finances people are a pain in the ass and honestly don't understand the team that well. Go over their head if you have to. Unless they get much more knowledgeable about exchange rates and the style of receipts in Australia (which they don't think are acceptable documentation), you probably will.
* WSC likes teams that communicate with them. Play their silly games on social media, jump through their hoops, and they'll be nicer to you.
* WSC enforced regulations much more strictly this cycle than last cycle. It's no longer a safe idea to count on them being lax with the rules. But do be ready to argue!
* Dealing with Stanford and WSC people will take up a lot more time than you think it will. Whoever is tasked with this -- team lead, business lead, someone else -- should be consistent in their approach and quick to respond to emails, and willing to sit through meetings that don't seem to accomplish much. And smile!
