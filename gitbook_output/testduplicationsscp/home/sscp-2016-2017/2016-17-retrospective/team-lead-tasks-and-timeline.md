## Team Lead Tasks and Timeline

Hopefully this will be helpful! These tasks have been divided between Cori, Maggie, Sarah, and Business Team, but here's what I was doing at a high level each month of the 2016-17 cycle. I also jumped in and worked on code stuff throughout the cycle and helped with a lot of build cycle stuff, which I'm not including -- new leadership will presumably jump in wherever makes the most sense for them. I've also noted in red things that I did at, in my opinion, the wrong time, with the suggested new time in parentheses.
