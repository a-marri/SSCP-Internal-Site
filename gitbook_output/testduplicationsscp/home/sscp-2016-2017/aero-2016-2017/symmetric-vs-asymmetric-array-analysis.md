## Symmetric vs Asymmetric Array Analysis

This page shows the difference in array power generation between two similar aero-bodies: an asymmetric (HRH-006) and a symmetric (BEN-013).  The array was 4m^2 array, non-diced.  Simulation took place just outside of Cooper Pedy (lat: -29.01111, long: 134.75555) from 8am-5pm.

Attached is a folder with all files necessary for re-running the simulation in Shellpower.

Graph of power generated over course of day

During the first half of the day, asymmetric has 50-100W improvement.  This is a ballpark estimate; Shellpower slightly underestimates power generation.

As expected, power generation is similar over the second half of the day.&#x20;

Also contains a day of Arctan Race data for comparison.  Click to view in new tab.
