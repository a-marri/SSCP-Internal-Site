# Driver Model

Driver Arc: The driver has a vision cone that sweeps 200 degrees around. The points at which the vision cone intersects with the car (that may be into a bubble, or into some other part of the car) must be clear for the driver to see. For the 5-fairing car and Luminos-style car, this vision cone essentially defines how curved the upper surface of the mainfoil must be.

The driver has a head sweep arc which defines the space that must be clear for the driver's head to move. To be as aggressive as possible, if you have a bubble, you'll want to hug that headsweep arc in a reasonably aerodynamic way. The arc doesn't reflect the 7 degrees side to side regulation because the officials did not test this in 2015 scrutineering. Thus, in an effort to make the bubble smaller, the arc does not have a constant radius side to side.

The red surfaces around the driver's sides and back provide rough guidelines on where the rules require 50mm of high-density foam. Try to keep most of this area within the driver compartment (this will limit fairing width for 5-fairing car). As we discussed at rule discussion meeting, this is a new rule.
