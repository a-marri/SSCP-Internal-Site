# SSCP - The Great Wind Tunnel Debate of 2017

# The Great Wind Tunnel Debate of 2017

Summary:

The reason we didn’t commit to Aerodyn was basically that the conclusion from talking to their engineers and Goro Tamai (author of definitive solar car aero book) was that the mounting system we would have to build would make any results we got invalid as far as rolling road goes.

Even before we got too behind schedule to go to a wind tunnel we had concluded that none of our options would let us simulate rolling road because of sundae’s size and shape.

None of our options had a true rolling road — Aerodyn has a boundary layer suction system that emulates it but we have never been sure just how good it is for a solar car, since it’s designed to be equivalent to a rolling road for a car with a ride height >3x that of a solar car.

We believe (based on conversations with experts, not any actual data) that a true rolling road would give definitive results for a solar car, if we could figure out how to mount properly (big if) and get into a tunnel with one (also big if).

Going forward, it seems like the best bet would be talking to Ford and GM since they definitely have true rolling road wind tunnels. None of the other options (Aerodyn, San Diego, UW, Specialized) do as far as the 2017 team could determine.

More details:

There are a lot of reasons to go to a wind tunnel, and they are achievable for any particular car to different extents. There are also a lot of reasons to be hesitant about going to any particular wind tunnel.

Comments from Alumni:

Sasha: It's worth keeping in mind that there's a lot of car that's well above the ground too. You'll find out if your angle of attack is bad or if your bubble is sucking. Further, it's a good rallying point to complete body and suspension.

I wouldn't take the whole team on such a trip. But it's very useful for the aero/mech folks to go, and very useful for the code/electrical folks to have a quiet shop for a week.

Having conducted the team and then watched teams for many years, it's clearly a valuable experience even if it doesn't give you exact drag curves. I would always thumbs-up a wind tunnel trip.
