# SU2 Meetings

### 3/13/2016 Meeting with Tom and David

[](#h.i1f8ueevthhd)

Tom and David helped us get SU2 set up on the cluster.  This powerpoint presentation is helpful for learning how to run things on SU2.  SU2 is a cluster of networked computers that all get a piece of the CFD workload, which allows the simulation to complete quickly, in parallel.

Last cycle, we began to explore some of the design features like automatic mesh deformation.  This cycle, given that we have our pipeline set up early, we hope to take full advantage of the many features SU2 has to offer.

Here are some instructions for running CFD on Sabalcore.

ToDo: Set new parameters in the config file to stop the CFD when it converges, rather than always just waiting for 10000 iterations to complete.
