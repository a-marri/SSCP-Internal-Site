This list will give a laundry list of all the tedious steps to surfacing a Challenger car example (in this case, Arctan). It's a work in progress at the moment -- Rachel and Yuji will be adding steps slowly but surely.

* Convert main foil sketchCreate a new sketch. Select the curve. Convert Entities.Select your new sketch. It has a constraint (little green cube) that is forcing it to be friends with your curve. You do not want them to be friends. Delete the little green cube.Now you can alter the airfoil proportions.Put the main foil on the correct planeRight click the sketch in the feature tree > Edit Sketch PlaneChoose the correct plane so that your sketch becomes oriented as such (this is the standard aero coordinate frame):

Fairings

* Import a foil similarly to the main foil to use for your overall fairing shapePut the fairing curve in the correct plane (look at step 3 on main body)
