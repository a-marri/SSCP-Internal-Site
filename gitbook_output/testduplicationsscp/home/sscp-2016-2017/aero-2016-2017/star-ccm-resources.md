We are using v11.02.010 of the software.  Use this version. Different versions have backward-compatibility issues.

Our StarCCM Power On Demand Code is vUSl0MSzi5Z1K7wgjxwKBO84rq0 You need this code when the software starts up.

Daniel Maldonado (dmaldo01@calpoly.edu) from Cal Poly's solar car team made a mesh and did CFD for Sunwhale-022 in STAR-CCM+, and made an instructional video along with that. 

Those resources are located on SFTP under Software>STAR-CCM+
