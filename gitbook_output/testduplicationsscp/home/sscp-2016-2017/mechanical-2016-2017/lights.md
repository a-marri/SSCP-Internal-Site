# Lights

A few shops Kelsey tried were too busy to give us quotes for CNC acrylic, so we tried Fictiv, which is a fast turnaround company for rapid prototyping. Fictiv does not offer CNC acrylic at the time of this order but they had a 3d print option called VeroClear which is marketed as having optical clarity and good surface finish. This seemed to be a better, cheaper option anyway, since the lights are very oddly shaped and would be more expensive to 3d print. Fictiv does 3d printed VeroClear for either 1 or 2 business day turnaround times. We chose 2 to save a couple hundred bucks.
