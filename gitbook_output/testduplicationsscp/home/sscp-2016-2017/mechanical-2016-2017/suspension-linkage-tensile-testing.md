## SSCP - Suspension Linkage Tensile Testing

## Suspension Linkage Tensile Testing

During the summer of 2016, we'd like to do tensile testing on the carbon fiber tube suspension linkages that the team used on Luminos.&#x20;

Gluing aluminum inserts in into carbon fiber tubes: DP 420

Tubes: Rock West Composites - No specifications available&#x20;

Notes:

Epoxy

I think we either used DP-460 or DP-460ns on the a-arms.

Tubes

As is the case for most carbon tubes, there are no specifications available. We asked the manufacturer (Rock West Composites), and they said that their customers prefer measuring the strength of the tubes themselves. Someone else will need to comment on the type of tubing that was used. For analysis, I think we pretended that the carbon was 7075-T6 or equivalent, and assumed that carbon was stronger. For reference, the reason we went with carbon tubes was because SSCP has no experience welding fatigue-prone aluminum parts. Every year, teams have problems with welded aluminum and fatigue. We decided to avoid the problem altogether by going with carbon/aluminum a-arms. We had spent a significant amount of time researching surface prep techniques. The process on the structural bonding guide is directly from a 3M aerospace apps engineer.

Green Stuff

EW-5000as is an epoxy primer - it lets you bond several days after the AC-130 process. It also does protect the aluminum from corrosion. When you buy it, make sure you get EW-5000as, not EW-5000(rather bad for you). Normally SSCP does Type II Alodine to protect aluminum parts from corrosion without damaging the fatigue strength. Normal sulfuric acid anodizing can reduce the fatigue strength of aluminum by up to 20%.&#x20;

Having fun with team bonding!
