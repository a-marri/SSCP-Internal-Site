Methodology for determining rough weight savings for titanium

Arctan Tubing:

* 1.125” OD, 0.935” IDTake arbitrary length of tubing and subject to external directed load (arbitrary length = 2ft)Evaluate FoS (assuming previous studies designed correctly) under some realistic external load (FoS ~ 1.2)
* 1.125” OD, 0.935” ID
* Take arbitrary length of tubing and subject to external directed load (arbitrary length = 2ft)
* Evaluate FoS (assuming previous studies designed correctly) under some realistic external load (FoS ~ 1.2)

1.125” OD, 0.935” ID

Take arbitrary length of tubing and subject to external directed load (arbitrary length = 2ft)

Evaluate FoS (assuming previous studies designed correctly) under some realistic external load (FoS ~ 1.2)

Find Titanium grade 9 (3Al-2.5V) tubing in size that gives approximately the same F.o.S. from the same load.

* Grade 9’s FoS ~ 1.5
* Grade 9’s FoS ~ 1.5

* Grade 9’s FoS ~ 1.5

Grade 9’s FoS ~ 1.5

4130 tubing

* Mass = 949.06 grams
* Length = 2 ft
* 474 gr/ft

Mass = 949.06 grams

Length = 2 ft

474 gr/ft

Titanium

* Mass = 577.88 grams
* Length = 2 ft
* 288.94 gr/ft

Mass = 577.88 grams

Length = 2 ft

288.94 gr/ft

Weight savings ~1.645x (could be more if I rerun simulation to optimize tubing size)

Translates to global weight savings of ~1.5 kg...
