MECHANICAL TOPICS

MOTORS

* Options: redesign mechanical housing; CSIRO; MitsubaWhat we need to know: could we make the old motors fit in the fairing? Aero gains if it's in the fairing? What are the efficiency numbers compared? How much do motors cost, and how could we get that money? Time to design/build a new mechanical housing? Ask Minnesota for CSIRO numbers and modification?Note: we can only get ballparks for a lot of these numbers in the time we haveAsk alums: DynamoFront vs real wheel driveRear-wheel drive means narrower fairing (doesn't have to turn) -- if we put in the rear, hard to achieve 60-40 front-rear weight balanceBest case: put in the front wheelDecision: Small enough to go in the wheel is huge priority, but otherwise we need more numbers

SUSPENSION

ROLL CAGE:

WHEEL SKIRTS/COVERS:

* Other top teams have aerodynamic stuff in the wheel-wellWould involve surfacing and making a mold -- Nuon has this as the last thing they do -- not a huge projectNeed to design from the beginning: cover vs skirt (if anything)Skirt: tied to the suspension, covers the area around the wheel; doesn't do anything for rear wheelsCover: Rachel says these are better -- keep the air from going turbulent within the body of the car -- routes the airKeep in mind: things that turn with the wheel have the tendency to break!Unfortunately, can't really model thisNeed to design it so that we could still do quick tire changes -- can't just throw it on at the end; need to testMichigan's estimate: 50W gained with having skirts on all four wheelsDecision: design from the beginning but make sure it could be left off if we decide it doesn't work after test driving

BRAKES:

* Should look into it -- need to have better brakesArctan had the very minimum brakes we could get away withEven if we don't change the brakes, we should look into changing the brake distribution --> test a lotMechanical brakes should be enough if the regenerative braking isn't functional!Are we limited by friction?

STEERING

* Current steering column ~6lbs plus more steel joints and aluminum linkages -- pretty heavy, especially compared to other designsOthers teams' designs run the gamut -- maybe be more like Michigan?
