# Steering Wheel 2016-17

See attached email for most design details.

Waterjet: The 1/8" panel was included in a large order with AST Waterjet.

Handles: The handles were surfaced (I made these early in the cycle to learn how to surface), and the clamshells were 3D printed with Shapeways. We used 3M's 4693H High Performance Industrial Plastic Adhesive to glue the clamshells around the carbon plate. This adhesive seemed to bond well to plastic for this purpose. Sid's Custom Upholstery wrapped the handles in leather.
