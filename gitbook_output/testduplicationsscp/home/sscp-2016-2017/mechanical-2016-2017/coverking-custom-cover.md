# SSCP - Coverking Custom Cover

# Coverking Custom Cover

Coverking has a custom car cover division which specializes in 3D scanning cars, then making a cover from the 3D model. The President of Coverking, Steve Gupta, has verbally agreed to both prototype a cover for Arctan and make a race cover for sundae. Since we already have 3D models of our cars, things work out very well.

Their webpage covering the service is here:

Coverking has signed the attached NDA in order to receive 3D models of our vehicles.

Coverking is capable of full sublimation graphics. An SSCP member to design the Arctan cover graphic is still needed.
