Suspension components and China

The front swing arm is a story of why you should not send suspension components, or any component with a tightly toleranced fit, to China for the sake of cheapness. It's just not worth it. In Arctan cycle, we had sent some parts to China with success, but the more critical suspension components like the upright and upper control arm were done either at Stratasys or in house. We later heard that parts from Xenith cycle that had been sent to China had been mostly rejected.

Feeling trusting and knowing that the leading-trailing arm design was more expensive than our former double-A arm designs, we sent the front swing arm to Sky Machining in Shenzhen. However, they informed us on the planned ship date that many of the bearing fits were out of tolerance, some by +0.04mm. We insisted that they remanufacture, but Sky instead proposed that they anodize the part for free, which would add 0.02-0.03mm of thickness to the part. Alums said that we could salvage the parts with Loctite, but at this point, the uprights, motor cap, and steering arm had all already gone to Sky, so we didn't want to risk those parts' tolerances by not standing our ground on the swing arm. We again insisted that Sky remanufacture the parts, that this was the only acceptable solution. When we heard from Sky a long couple of days later, they announced that they had fixed the parts! Ta-da! Suspicious, I asked them what method they had used to do so. Sky said that they had welded the material (without our permission) and then machined out the holes again to get the correct tolerances, and that this would not affect strength. In fact, the parts would be annealed by welding them and the yield strength compromised by almost half in whatever areas were reached by the welding. Looking at FEA, the parts could not afford to be compromised by this much in the bearing areas. Alums said that re-heat treating the aluminum would get the parts' strength back, but that that would definitely screw up the part dimensions. We resigned ourselves to remanufacturing the swing arms with ProEngineering, as Sky was clearly unwilling to work with us to do the job correctly and it was wasting our time to try to get them to.
