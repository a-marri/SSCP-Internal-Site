# SSCP - Intro to CNC Machining

# Intro to CNC Machining

THIS IS A BASIC INTRODUCTION TO MACHINING AND IS NOT MEANT TO BE USED AS A REFERENCE FOR COMPLEX PROJECTS. ALWAYS CONSULT A SENIOR CNC USER FIRST.

Notes taken during first CNC orientation on 5/4/16. CNC notes will be updated/filled in with time.

Attached to this page is an intro project from an ME class.

NOTE: The CNC will NOT STOP if you tell it to cut into itself - i.e. if the drill runs off your part and collides with the CNC itself, it will self destruct.

CNC & HSM Machining & HSM

CNC = Computer Numerical Control

HSM = High-Speed Machining

Feed & Speed

* Spindle speed:
* Surface speed: approx. the same regardless of process; how fast outside edge is; depends on diameter and rpm
* Cutting feed rate (in/min): how fast you cut through material
* Plunge Speed: generally very low, don’t generally want to be plunging into material for any process

Things to Keep in Mind When Machining:

* Specify a larger design radius than machine radius (so you don’t cut into part)
* Vertical fillets (beware of radius, don't want the blade to have to make a 90º turn)
* External fillets (tend to scallop curved corners (stair-stepping))

Designing

1. Orient view to face the top (overhead view) of your part

2. Select your drill type: generally face mill

(*note: you cannot plunge straight down with this tool, only sideways)

3. Modify speeds: default speeds are the default setting, you can modify speeds here for the current process but these will be temporary changes (ie. altering speeds will not alter the defaults or persist for future use)

4. Set heights:

Clearance Height: top of part (so drill knows collision boundaries it may have with part)

Retract Height:

5. Run the Simulation:

* Path Colors:Green = tool lead inBlue = tool cutting pathPlay → runs simulation
* Path Colors:Green = tool lead inBlue = tool cutting path
* Green = tool lead in
* Blue = tool cutting path
* Play → runs simulation

* Path Colors:Green = tool lead inBlue = tool cutting path
* Green = tool lead in
* Blue = tool cutting path
* Play → runs simulation

Path Colors:

* Green = tool lead in
* Blue = tool cutting path

Green = tool lead in

Blue = tool cutting path

Play → runs simulation

NOTE:

* Check that your tool is long enough to cut the depth that you specifyThe CNC will NOT STOP if you tell it to cut into itself - i.e. if the drill runs off your part and collides with the CNC itself, it will self destruct.
