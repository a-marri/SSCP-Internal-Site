Hayden Hall's notes:

* Machine a section of IG Rohacell foam to fit in the aerobody layup adjacent to the driver
* Alignment of Roll Cage - we proposed using rod-ends to provide adjustability when bolting the cage into the panels (would get rid of moment at the point of attachment; Nathan Golshan expressed concerns about properly analyzing these pickups, so this idea was scrapped). Instead, alumni recommended using holes on roll cage to manually match drill the holes in the carbon panel, then using shims (or liquid shims) to make sure that all mounting bolts were equally loaded (e.g. 3/3 bolts would share load in case of impact).&#x20;
* Concern that alumni had: the mounting plates for the rollcage are effectively all in the same plane (parallel to ground). They are also too close together longitudinally. This means that the cage effectively acts like a giant lever in the case of a roll-over (imagine worst case scenario -- car on roof, sliding, cage snags on pothole). Spread out mounting bosses so that they resist this type of moment.&#x20;
* Outsourcing the cage - company from last time probably wouldn't do it again - Questions to ask shop: shop's capabilities of tube sizing, thickness, and bend radii (in particular minimum bend radius for each mandrel size).
* Welding Jig: Ask if they can make welding jig; in past we just waterjet cut steel that the shop tacked together. Things to consider when designing this jig: can it be assembled and disassembled during welding of the cage?
* give the cage manufacturers dimensions that they can actually measure (e.g. distance between parallel faces, distance between outside of tubing, etc.)
* Suggestion on improving the roll cage's top weld. In current design we had a weld at the very top, but welds+heating of 4130 make this a likely point of failure in the case of a flip-over. Instead, have a piece of tubing hug the top of the bubble, with welds on either side. Heat-treating should normalize the brittleness of the 4130, but it's better to be safe than sorry.

-Remember to not add core to the bubble layup in places where the cage will end up being!

* Post-treated Arctan roll cage
* Possibility of mounting starboard roll cage support to hat stiffener in the aerobody layup - could be Rohacell with an aluminum insert - might need to dimension that part of the roll cage after the aerobody is manufactured.
* Alternatively, you could add bent steel tubing or titanium to the starboard wall of occupant cell and weld the roll cage pick-up point. Would still need to custom-machine Rohacell to fit around the tubing.
* Discussed possible ways of the mounting the front and rear shocks. They suggested adding a panel inline with the rear shock so that it would take the load (rather than having this load be transmitted into the cage)

&#x20;

* Alumni disliked the idea of mounting the roll cage and the rear shock to the same panel
* Do not want to have asymmetric stiffness in the rear suspension ("It's bad to have a loose rear suspension. It's even worse to have an uneven loose rear suspension").
* Advocated for 1:1 motion ratio, especially if we use Ohlin dampers.
* Idea of bell crank linking front shocks to uprights
