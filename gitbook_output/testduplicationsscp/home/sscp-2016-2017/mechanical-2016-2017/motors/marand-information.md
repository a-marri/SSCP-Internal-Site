### Marand/CSIRO Motors

August 2016

Marand/CSIRO has a new motor that bolts directly into the wheel. We should look into it, according to alumni from Design Review I.&#x20;

1. Efficiency curves.&#x20;
2. Specs and CAD files.&#x20;
3. Integration with EE system (voltage, max current, etc)
4. Thermal considerations
5. Dust, dirt ingress/egress
6. MountingMaintenance
7. Maintenance
8. Cost (can we afford multiple?)
9. Compare with Warpcore

However, I am of the perspective that the CSIRO design is lacking in a couple critical ways.

* Its performance is highly dependent on tolerance stackup, notoriously difficult to control in an hub motor with handmade epoxy components.
* The phase and sense wiring must go through the center shaft, a nightmare for reliability during wheel swaps, tire seating, assembly, etc.
* There is virtually nowhere for the heat generated in the stator to go, causing it to overheat uncomfortably quickly.
* They are prone to cracking, going open circuit, shorting due to rubbing, and ingesting debris.
* They're extremely difficult to assemble due to the magnificent magnetic force.

Thank you for your enquiry about Marand’s ultra high efficiency electric motors.  Marand is currently offering a range of in-wheel motors based upon the popular CSIRO solar car motor, but currently only has one size of motor.

&#x20;

Marand will begin manufacture of the Motor with an Electronic Transfer to the value of 50% of the Sale price of the motor (Motor options below) and will seek full payment prior to shipping

&#x20;

Marand’s range currently includes the kit motor and two variants of complete wheel motor:

&#x20;

•           In-Wheel Motor Kit:

The Kit Motor consists of a set of very strong Neodymium Magnet rings and a High Efficiency Litz-Wire Stator.  The solar car team needs to build a wheel of their own design to house the motor. Priced at $12,000 AUD, this option is very popular as it is the most cost effective solution.

&#x20;

Price: $12,000 AUD                   Lead Time: 6-8 Weeks

&#x20;

•           Through Axle Wheel Motor:

A turn key traction solution for solar car teams, the wheel motor builds the motor into a three piece wheel housing.  The advantage of this design is the rim is quickly and easily replaced should it be damaged due to tyre blowout or other accident.  Manufactured out of aerospace grade aluminium, the wheel is both light and strong.

&#x20;

Static Load Rating: 150kg

Price: $26,000 AUD                   Lead Time: 10-12 Weeks

&#x20;

•           Stub Axle Wheel Motor:

A new design of wheel motor to cater for the new class of heavier, four wheeled solar vehicles.  Built on the advantages of the through axle wheel motor, the housing has been strengthened to handle increased vertical and side loads, and incorporates a double row angular contact ball bearing for increased reliability.

&#x20;

Static Load Rating: 200kg

Price: $26,000 AUD                   Lead Time: 10-12  Weeks

&#x20;

All motors are tested on our custom built dynamometer for both peak efficiency and power, and are supplied with a set of high efficiency inductors. All prices above are ex-GST and ex-Works Moorabbin, Australia.  A formal quotation including freight to your location can be supplied on request although to do so we require a full billing address, contact name, number & if it differs a full shipping address, contact name & number. &#x20;

&#x20;

Please find attached an information pack for all of the above motor options.  This includes application notes, drawings, info sheets, CAD files and a thermal model.

&#x20;

Marand does not currently supply motor controllers; however you can contact Tritium in Brisbane, Australia who manufactures a motor controller specifically designed for solar car racing.  www.tritium.com.au
