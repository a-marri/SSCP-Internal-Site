Marand vs WarpCore decision

We need to decide whether we should purchase new motors or keep current Warp Motors.  Marand motors have been recommended by Sam Lenius.  Cost, performance, and time-required-to-implement are criteria important to this decision.

We will decide by October 23.

Possible Modifications to WarpCores for this cycle

1. Redesign brake discs to allow for a larger case diameter, hence a larger rotor diameter and consequently shorter stack height.
2. Design new motor housing to fit thinner suspension.  How much would materials & manufacturing cost?Rewind motors to reduce peak efficiency speed.  The, efficiency analysis of predicted speed.Implement Sam's updated magnetics design as mentioned in the attached email thread.  What is the scope of this project?Modified stator (brings efficiency to \~98%)
3. Rewind motors to reduce peak efficiency speed.  The, efficiency analysis of predicted speed.
4. Implement Sam's updated magnetics design as mentioned in the attached email thread.  What is the scope of this project?Modified stator (brings efficiency to \~98%)
5. Modified stator (brings efficiency to \~98%)

Email from NHS at beginning of Sundae cycle:

I've got a task for you guys. As you probably know, Sam L and I designed the motors that you used for Arctan. Given that they've now been through two races, the burden to verify that they're still good to go is higher.

Last time around, we used dye analysis on the titanium spindle to check for cracks. I heard that there was quite a bit of abuse this cycle, so I highly recommend that you have x-ray crack inspection done of the entire motor. We use a couple different companies at Tesla...I can recommend one if needed.

You'll also want to do bearing replacements on all of the motors, but that can come later. Getting an x-ray inspection sponsored will probably take some time.

Also, I'd like to remind you of the motor log and maintenance instructions. Please use it to record all issues, changes, or incidents that happen to the motors. Also check there for maintenance instructions.

[motor log and maintenance instructions](../../../../../../stanford.edu/testduplicationsscp/home/sscp-2012-2013/mechanical-2012-2013/motors/warp-motor/)

Finally, a reminder when handling motors...DO NOT DROP THEM! They've been designed for a 100g shock, but dropping one any distance could easily be 200-300 gs.

Finally, please ask us if you're unsure about anything...doing the wrong thing to a motor is way, way worse than waiting a couple hours for some guidance.

Happy leadership,

NHS
