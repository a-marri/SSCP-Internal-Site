# SSCP - Meeting with Sila Nanotechnologies

# Meeting with Sila Nanotechnologies

Notes

- Gene is skeptical of LG/Samsung pouch cells (will not have great specific density)

- Gene is skeptical of LiS for this cycle. Does not believe the technology is commercialized enough for us to acquire the amount of storage we need.

- 40K+ for OXIS cells sounds reasonable

    - 20 cells from Sila would be valued around the same

- They have lots of lab test and analysis equipment we might be able to use.

    - Arbin battery cyclers

    - SEM (Scanning electron microscopes)

- Possible financial donation (we should ask)

- Interested in recruiting (we can help them with this)

- Wants strategy numbers to see how much of an impact Sila cells could have

- Interesting fixtures for cell testing 

    - Mike will look to emulate them here (3D print)

Follow Up

- Thank you email (Eerik and Gene)

- Provide strategy numbers (baseline 18650B, 18650G, and Sila based cells)

    - Need Sila specs (4.2 ah?)

- Business team follow up for sponsorship
