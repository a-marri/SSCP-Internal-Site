## SSCP - Meeting with Sila Nanotechnologies

## Meeting with Sila Nanotechnologies

Notes

* Gene is skeptical of LG/Samsung pouch cells (will not have great specific density)
* Gene is skeptical of LiS for this cycle. Does not believe the technology is commercialized enough for us to acquire the amount of storage we need.
* 40K+ for OXIS cells sounds reasonable

&#x20;   \- 20 cells from Sila would be valued around the same

* They have lots of lab test and analysis equipment we might be able to use.

&#x20;   \- Arbin battery cyclers

&#x20;   \- SEM (Scanning electron microscopes)

* Possible financial donation (we should ask)
* Interested in recruiting (we can help them with this)
* Wants strategy numbers to see how much of an impact Sila cells could have
* Interesting fixtures for cell testing&#x20;

&#x20;   \- Mike will look to emulate them here (3D print)

Follow Up

* Thank you email (Eerik and Gene)
* Provide strategy numbers (baseline 18650B, 18650G, and Sila based cells)

&#x20;   \- Need Sila specs (4.2 ah?)

* Business team follow up for sponsorship
