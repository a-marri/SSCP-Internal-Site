Guidelines

&#x20;   \- Examples suggest that neck down design is bad for current path

&#x20;   \- Need confirmation that a thinned neck design provides mechanical advantages (lower stress)

&#x20;           \- FEA this? Pull tests?

See Amada Miyachi tab design guide

&#x20;   \- Send design over to Jeff Berlin and team for feedback (send multiple designs over, have them comment and select)

&#x20;   \- Slots (prevent current shunting by not traveling through the battery cap)

&#x20;   \- Projections (raised bumps, essentially) focus heat on smaller points so weld joint gets hotter

Prototyping

&#x20;   3D Printing

&#x20;       \- Due to the lead time and other inefficiencies that come with chem-etching collector plates, we are going to look to 3D print our prototype designs to check fits. This will make our actual production of CPs with Italix far smoother.

Below are the rules and D\&T for chem-etching that we need to match or get close for 3D printing

#### Dimensions & Tolerances

There are a few design rules which express practical limitations when the dimensions under consideration approach the thickness of the metal. The most common rules are as follows:

#### Embedded Content

Embedded content: [Custom embed](collector-plate-design.md)

&#x20;Typical Tolerances are +/- 10% of material thickness (T)
