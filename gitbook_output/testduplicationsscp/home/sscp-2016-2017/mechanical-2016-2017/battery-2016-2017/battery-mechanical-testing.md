TEST CONDITIONS (Final)

【Test Condition】

1. Charging pack or module to 100% SOC

2. Nail Specification:(Diameter) Φ2.5mm (Length) 45mm

3. Penetration speed: 5mm/sec

4. Depth of penetration: Max.1⁄2 initiating cell diameter

(Max.9mm from initiating cell surface)

5. Test temperature: Worst (Highest) temperature in your specific charge temp.

6. To make hole on pack case in advance so that it easy to penetrate

7. Observe for reaching to room temperature after test

1.//

Please advise SSCP as follows.

If cell bricks are isolated and no influence from neighborhood brick is expected, the anti-propagation test can be performed with one brick.

If any influence is estimated, the test should be done with concerned multiple bricks. The number of cells can be determined accordingly.

To be on safer side, if possible, max number (3?) of bricks may be tested, but it’s up to SSCP.

If SSCP firmly believes their isolation design, we will follow it as long as it’s proven by their evaluation result.

 

In any cases, we require that the anti-propagation test should be performed at the highest temperature for charging.

 (ex. If temp. range for charging is +10deg.C to +45deg.C, the test needs to done at +45deg.C.)

Please remember to advise SSCP of this point.

Here are comments from our engineers.

 

-VENTILATION

Regarding ventilation, we will implement cut outs in the box to accommodate ventilation fans for each of the 3 modules. The vents will be designed to allow gas to flow out but it will prevent debris and water and dust from coming in.

(Comments from Panasonic) Understood.

 

- ISOLATION

Isolation between cells is going to be provided by some fabric or gel that we insert in the gaps. We are looking at a non-conductive Mica fabric or, if Panasonic has the bandwidth, its own material.  {Note from Paul to Henry:  I am waiting for a reply from Marshall Funaba whether or not Panasonic can promote our thermal materials for batteries.  He should tell me any day.}

(Comments from Panasonic) How is the Mica fabric to be attached between cells? (Every cell? Or, some grouped cells?)

 

- FUSING

Lastly, regarding cell-level fusing we are looking into ways we might implement this, but this is something we might not be able to do without sacrificing huge performance metrics. We hope to not be required to implement fusing on the cell level because it would drastically how we do our collector plate and interconnects and introduce a lot of unnecessary resistance that will only penalize our car's performance.  In previous years, the pack has had fusing, but not at the block or cell level  {Note from Paul to Henry:  Does Panasonic have some expectation here, like a fused collector plate, or tabbed interconnects for cells like thin wires?  If so, the series resistance will increase.}

(Comments from Panasonic) Understood. It’s not a must as long as the anti-propagation test cab be passed.

 

- TESTING

Please let me know if you have any updates on when we might be able to secure an initial delivery of the test cells? And we would like a final or near-final set of guidelines for the nail test before the Holidays.

(Comments from Panasonic)

(a)  Basically, no change. Please find page 1 of the attached file.

To be clear, the worst case temperature is specified as the max. temp. for charging.

The worst case nailing position is also specified.

(b)  Either way is fine.

(c)  (Replied in another mail earlier today)

(d   Please refer to page 2 of the attached file.

Decision needed:

* How to interpret "fully wired" (welded to collector plate so cells are in parallel)?
* Puncture mechanism and location
* Testing timelineNeeds to occur discretely and in a safe environment
* Needs to occur discretely and in a safe environment
* How to iterate quickly on designs (will be expensive ~$1200) for several quickly 3D printed iterations
* How to iterate quickly on collector plates
