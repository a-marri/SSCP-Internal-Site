# SSCP - Welding

# Welding

This page is for organizing our research and findings on welding and collector plates (CP). We will need to weld our battery cells to collector plates of some sort. 

The hard deadline for sourcing a welder is end of Fall Quarter 2017. The hard deadline for CP design is mid-November and prototype delivery is start of Winter. 

Key Factors

* Collector plate material (Ni, Cu, Al) and gauge (thickness)Weight and power loss trade offs [DO MATH]
* Weight and power loss trade offs [DO MATH]
* Laser or Resistive Spot [Lower resistance needs 
* Accessibility (In-house or off-campus, scheduling, dependency)
* Cost (Purchase/Sponsorship)

Options (Arctan)

* Option A: Nickel metal (0.010" gauge). Borrow resistance welder from Mission Motors again.Option B: Laser weld nickel metal of 0.010" gauge. Company: Inta Technologies (408-748-9955). Contact: Jerry, jerry@intatech.com
* Option B: Laser weld nickel metal of 0.010" gauge. 
* Company: Inta Technologies (408-748-9955). Contact: Jerry, jerry@intatech.com
* Option C: Laser weld copper alloy plates of 0.015" gauge (minimum required for many laser welding operations).This could have the lowest contact resistance, but would weigh moreCompany: Inta Technologies (408-748-9955). Contact: Jerry, jerry@intatech.comOption D: Buy cheap resistance welder to weld nickel metal. Cheap welders (<$1500) can only solder up to 0.05" gauge, it seems. 1800-2000 square inches of 0.010" nickel metal (Ni 200/201) for electrical uses. Talk to Emily Henriksson about any details on the battery needs. Research nickel-plated aluminum and ways to solder these tabs to batteries. If that doesn't work, we'll go for nickel again.
