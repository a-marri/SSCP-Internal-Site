## Meeting w/ Ian Girard (5/25)

Mechanical Switch

&#x20;    \- Low side contactor is a physical switch

&#x20;    \- Pull lever to start

&#x20;    \- To be determined by rules; if no mechanical switch requirement, decision to scrap switch

Discharge once, check SoC vs C

No need to cycle too many times (race pack will only undergo max 20 cycles)

SoC vs Voltage, current, and temperature

Verify authenticity of cells by mass

&#x20;   \- Still need real cell for comparison

P\&S count will be important

Laser welding

* recommends we go with resistance welding
* tentative access to Tesla's laser welder if needed
* designing for laser welding (fixtures and etc) would be more interesting
* need to justify extra effort

Resistance welders?

&#x20;    \- How do we procure resistance welders

&#x20;    \- LithiumStart

&#x20;    \- Mission Motors

&#x20;    \- Amada Miyachi&#x20;

Potentially able to get 18650H from Tesla? (or new, unnamed form factor: potentially 5-10% increase)

&#x20;    \- Get back to Ian once rules come out.&#x20;

&#x20;    \- Gravimetric energy density of new form factor will be impressive

&#x20;    \- New form factor will be larger and have more mass
