# SSCP - Meeting w/ Ian Girard (5/25)

# Meeting w/ Ian Girard (5/25)

Mechanical Switch

     - Low side contactor is a physical switch

     - Pull lever to start

     - To be determined by rules; if no mechanical switch requirement, decision to scrap switch

Discharge once, check SoC vs C

No need to cycle too many times (race pack will only undergo max 20 cycles)

SoC vs Voltage, current, and temperature

Verify authenticity of cells by mass

    - Still need real cell for comparison

P&S count will be important

Laser welding

- recommends we go with resistance welding

- tentative access to Tesla's laser welder if needed

- designing for laser welding (fixtures and etc) would be more interesting

- need to justify extra effort

Resistance welders?

     - How do we procure resistance welders

     - LithiumStart

     - Mission Motors

     - Amada Miyachi 

Potentially able to get 18650H from Tesla? (or new, unnamed form factor: potentially 5-10% increase)

     - Get back to Ian once rules come out. 

     - Gravimetric energy density of new form factor will be impressive

     - New form factor will be larger and have more mass
