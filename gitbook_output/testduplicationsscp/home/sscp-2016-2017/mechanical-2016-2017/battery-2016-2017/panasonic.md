Notes

- 2015 procurement did not go smoothly

- Donation vs purchase (technical support if bought)

- Don't know if its a donation or a sale this year

- Indemity draft is being written right now

- G's exist but they are not "safe"

- Testing

    - 1000C-1200C if cell combust

    - What is the motivation of increasing the safety requirements (Logan)?

            - Only release cells to companies that demonstrate safety

            - Recall issues

            - Worried about safety and legal issues

- Fire propagation test report

    - Woven mica was an improvement

    - Concrete guidelines (separation + materials)

            - declined

            - Will not give concrete recommendations

    - Industrial.panasonic.com (official pack makers)

 

- Want to see fire propagation test (ONLY TEST) (Must be made with full block/module, wired in, full charge 4.2V, 3 hours in 46C, cell must be surrounded by other cells)

            - destroy one cell, won't spread fire

- Will ask Japan for 18650G for us (assumption was that we want 18650GA)* We need to follow up on this! 

- Time lags for distribution

    - charged to 40% SOC (boat shipping would be 6 weeks max & air shipping is usually going to happening) 

    - follow up on storage conditions and capacity recovery efficiency 

Follow Ups

Secure 18650G's instead of 18650GA's

Find data on storage loss (calculate potential capacity loss for various timeframes)

Set pack development timeframe

Nail test design

Welder procurement

Collector plate initial design

    - account for flex (Paul)
