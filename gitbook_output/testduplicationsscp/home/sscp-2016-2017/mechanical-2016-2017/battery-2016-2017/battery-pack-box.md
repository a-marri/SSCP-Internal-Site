Key Features

    - Access panels

    - Connector cave

    - Flange for panels to be set and flush against rest of pack

    - Rubber seal on flange

    - Isolation between cell components

Challenges    

    - Latching locations (needed dimensions for calculations later)

    - Mounting at an angle (HD foam?)

    - Ventilation (?)

    - Need to create mockup

Dimensions

    14.65"

    21.65"

    9.0"

Latching:

20 g compliance

    - (30-35 kg) * 20 * 9.81 = 5886 N

    - If we estimate our pack mass at around 30 kg, we will need a heftier latch. Latches are documented in the pdf.

    - Weight from larger striker and latch helps with ballasting but might make handling of the pack tougher.

    - 4 mounting points: 2 latches and 2 pins + receivers

Latches considered:
