## Battery Cell Procurement

Potential Suppliers/Technology

Li-ion

Tesla

* Ian will look into 18650H, other options
* May be able to help this cycle
* Currently the only 18650 option

Panasonic

* Looking for 18650Gs
* Max/Kate/Jim called early Spring
* Paul Dennig: Panasonic Japan made the decision to only sponsor Tokai
* Will no longer pursue
* Need 18650G (or H) spec sheet
* Will need Paul or another contact to send data sheet to WSC
* Looking unlikely (as of 6/29/16 - update with specifics)
* Contact possibly reestablished (7/17)

Kokam (Li-Po)

[Kokam (Li-Po)](http://kokam.com/cell/)

* South Korean manufacturer of cells
* Investigating scale and quality
* Looks like they produce for defense contractors (UAV applications)
* battery@kokam.com&#x20;

&#x20;   \- Submitted request through site (7/15)

&#x20;   \- Need to email/Look for person to contact

&#x20;   \- Ike Hong (ike@kokam.com)

&#x20;   \- Cecilia Park (cecilia@kokam.com)

* FOLLOW UP in October (david.peterson@jkpower.com)

LG Chem

* Cells used by GM, Hyundai, etc
* Pouch cells
* Need datasheet/specs (GM might not tell us what cells but we can find something with similar grav density as 18650s)
* Contact:

&#x20;   \- Mohamed Alamgir&#x20;

&#x20;   \- Edvin Eriksen (emailed 7/17)

* Need follow up

&#x20;   \- Edvin came with LG Chem counterpart (Dave)

&#x20;   \- Optimistic meeting, showed interest in battery + financial support

&#x20;   \- Speculated possible "binning" of battery cells

&#x20;   \- Written confirmation of interest needed

General Motors

* Priority is knowledge and experience transfer
* Will inquire about possible equipment and cell donations

Samsung SDI

* Need to find a contact through Samsung SDI
* Mike will reach out
* Contacts:&#x20;

&#x20;   \- Stefan Roepke (General Manager at Samsung SDI NA)

&#x20;           \- stefan.iphestos@gmail.com

&#x20;   \- Fabrice Hudry (VP of Samsung SDI)

* Pranav is looking into contacts (7/13)

e-Transportation (Distributor in Luxembourg)

[e-Transportation](http://www.e-transportation.eu/catalog/category.php?id_category=10)

* Twente's contact

Air Energy (Li-Po)

[Air Energy](http://airenergy.de)

* Germany pack manufacturer
* High energy density (need to figure out what cells they use)

Sila

[Sila](http://www.silanano.com/)

* Cannot sponsor us this cycle
* Plan to visit June 2016

Envia

[Envia](http://www.enviasystems.com/#about)

* Max contacted Forrest North, a solarcar alumni who has a contact there June 4
* Professor Majumdar (ME Dept/Mike's advisor) is on the board
* Will contact Prof. Majumdar and cold-email the co-founder

Li-S

Oxis Energy

* Gawan contacted CEO and general contact email June 5
* Mike will follow up
* $18,000+ for 20 cells for "a testing project"&#x20;
* "Short format"

&#x20;   \- 240 Wh/kg \* 15 kg = 3.6 kWh pack

* "Long format"

&#x20;   \- 300 Wh/kg \* 15 kg = 4.5 kWh pack

* Conclusion: not worth it - will not procure.

Sion

* Kelsey will call June 6
* Mike will follow up

Polyplus

[Polyplus](http://www.polyplus.com/)

* Developing Li-S and "Protected Lithium Electrode"
