- Pranav is looking into contacts (7/13)

e-Transportation (Distributor in Luxembourg)

[e-Transportation](http://www.e-transportation.eu/catalog/category.php?id_category=10)

- Twente's contact

Air Energy (Li-Po)

[Air Energy](http://airenergy.de)

- Germany pack manufacturer

- High energy density (need to figure out what cells they use)

Sila

[Sila](http://www.silanano.com/)

- Cannot sponsor us this cycle

- Plan to visit June 2016

Envia

[Envia](http://www.enviasystems.com/#about)

- Max contacted Forrest North, a solarcar alumni who has a contact there June 4

- Professor Majumdar (ME Dept/Mike's advisor) is on the board

- Will contact Prof. Majumdar and cold-email the co-founder

Li-S

Oxis Energy

- Gawan contacted CEO and general contact email June 5

- Mike will follow up

- $18,000+ for 20 cells for "a testing project" 

- "Short format"

    - 240 Wh/kg * 15 kg = 3.6 kWh pack

- "Long format"

    - 300 Wh/kg * 15 kg = 4.5 kWh pack

- Conclusion: not worth it - will not procure.

Sion

- Kelsey will call June 6

- Mike will follow up

Polyplus

[Polyplus](http://www.polyplus.com/)

- Developing Li-S and "Protected Lithium Electrode"

- Based in Berkeley, CA
