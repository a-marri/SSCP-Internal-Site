General Battery Literature and Information

Battery Storage

The effects of battery aging due to storage conditions (humidity, temperature, and pressure) and time are not well understood. However, there are some references with data that suggest that losses from storage are significant and relevant.

In short, higher temperatures and charge will drastically degrade a cell's capacity. It is easily avoided if cells are kept around 40% charge and room temperature 25C.&#x20;

Mechanical Design

Pack Design and Fitment

For asymmetric, using HRH-006 for fit check.

Methodology&#x20;

1. Use blocks of "cell modules", aligned in a pattern.
2. Create rectangular block for entire configuration afterwards.

Relevant WSC Regulations

23 2.5.2 Teams must contact the event organiser for the allowable total cell mass if other cell chemistries or a mix of cell chemistries is proposed. The allowable total cell mass of rechargeable electrochemical cells is not restricted for Cruiser solar cars. However, the external energy used by a Cruiser class solar car, including the energy stored at the start, will contribute to its energy efficiency score.&#x20;

2.5.3 Teams must submit detailed specifications of the cells they intend to use.&#x20;

2.5.4 The nominal mass of each cell must be specified and endorsed by the manufacturer. Specifications from third party suppliers or found on the internet might not match those endorsed by manufacturers.&#x20;

2.5.5 If the event organiser receives conflicting or unclear specifications of nominal cell mass for a particular cell model, the Chief Energy Scientist will determine the nominal cell mass for cells of that model.&#x20;

2.5.6 The sum of the nominal cell masses (i.e., summed over all cells) must be not more than the allowable total cell mass.&#x20;

2.5.7 The energy storage system must be contained within at most two packs.&#x20;

2.5.8 Electrochemical cells must not, at any time, be operated outside of the operating ranges for voltage, current and temperature specified by the manufacturer. Teams must provide documentation that describes how they monitor their electrochemical cells, and what the team and the solar car will do if any cell goes outside specified operating limits. Teams must obtain endorsement by their certifying engineer that an adequate and effective monitoring regime has been designed and implemented, and that any fault condition can be safely managed.&#x20;

2.5.9 Any charging system with ac input that is used to recharge the energy storage system (when allowed) must meet the following requirements: ● the charger must be used with a residual current device ● the charger must be either permanently connected to the energy storage system, or connect to the energy storage system using an appropriate connector ● the output of the charger must be electrically isolated from the ac input ● the charger must stop charging automatically when the energy storage system is full or if a fault occurs.&#x20;

2.5.13 Energy storage packs must mounted in the solar car so that they will be restrained in a 20 g acceleration

.&#x20;

2.5.14 If an energy storage pack is capable of spilling dangerous liquids when damaged, there must be a spill-proof barrier between that energy storage pack and the solar car occupants.&#x20;

2.5.15 If an energy storage pack is capable of emitting dangerous gases when damaged, the solar car must be designed so that any gases will be vented to the exterior of the solar car behind any occupant ventilation intake.&#x20;

2.5.16 Removable energy storage packs enable teams to work on their solar car while their energy storage packs are impounded. If energy storage packs are removable then: ● each energy storage pack must remain in safe state while not connected to the solar car ● the team must provide a lockable box for storing energy storage packs while they are impounded.&#x20;

2.5.17 Energy storage packs must be constructed so that each pack can be sealed using tamper-evident plastic seals, similar to 3 × 100 mm plastic cable ties. With seals fitted, it must not be possible to remove any cell from a pack without breaking the seal. Seals will be provided by, and fitted by, the event organiser at scrutineering.
