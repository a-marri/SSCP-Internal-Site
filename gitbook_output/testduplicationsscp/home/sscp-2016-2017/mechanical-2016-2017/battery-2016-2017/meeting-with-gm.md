Any Any advice on how best to do this? Do you possibly have any electrical component catalog that we could take a look at? Not all of our electronics need to be automotive grade, but it would be nice to have access to a catalog for the few that do.How to you determine safety factor, robustness, lifespan. What values do you typically aim for? What should we be aiming for on a car that is going to go less than 10,000 miles in its lifetime.Any unexpected things that could go wrong with the board?Advice on contactors? What should the system requirements be? The system should never see more than 100A during normal operation, but the motor controllers can theoretically pull up to 122A if something in the code when awry. What is your philosophy on safety margins.Any advice on learning on the fly?

Notes

TODO: Clean up and merge

Li-S

* &#x20;     No one makes Li-S that are commercialized
* &#x20;     Research batteries
* &#x20;     One exception: Sion Power
* &#x20;     Give Sion a call

&#x20;

Pouch vs. Cylindrical (What is the optimal form factor/cell selection)

* &#x20;     Energy to Power ratio

o   Low power

o   Draw

* &#x20;     5.2 kWh from the last pack
* &#x20;     4 KW motors

o   Do they run 4 kW for the whole race

* &#x20;     All the GM cells are pouch/prismatic
* &#x20;     Look at the ratio of mass in the cells and in the tubing

o   Mass penalty in the cans

o   Look for lighter cans

* &#x20;     Tesla is going to a different form factor (look into this)

o   5 mm taller, 3 mm larger diameter

o   Look into shareholder meeting notes

* &#x20;     Look at Apple’s batteries

o   C-ATL (Apple’s pouch cells)

o   GM’s pouch cells have way more power than we need

o   Take apart an IPAD battery (iFixit.com)

* &#x20;     Pouch cell’s need compression

o   18650 has hoop stress to prevent expansion

o   Performance doesn’t correspond with compression

o   Pouches need compression

§  Race might be so specific that we don’t need to compress

§  Test for this

* &#x20;     Tricky attachment from cell to cell

o   Tabs positive and negative

o   Aluminum tab and a copper tab

§  Need to join aluminum to copper

·      Ultrasonic welding

·      Chevy Volt battery pack

·      A123 (laser welding)

* &#x20;     Put us in touch with people who work with that

o   4P vs 6P model

* &#x20;     Put together a list of concepts to look at

o   Evaluate different cells

o   Make selection

o   Confirm the right decision

§  Refine design assumptions

§  Deeper analysis

* &#x20;     BMS stuff

&#x20;

&#x20;

DFMEA (Design Failure Mode and Effect Analysis

* &#x20;     System of failure mode analysis
* &#x20;     Draw connections between interfaces

o   Electrical

o   Mechanical

o   Clearances

&#x20;

IHS 3172&#x20;

&#x20;

Safety factors

&#x20;           Minimize hold power while keeping SF

&#x20;           200 Amp contactors (motor controllers are rated for 122 A)

&#x20;           Found contactor to save 30 percent of the energy (rated for only 100 Amps)

Robustness / Reliability

* DFMEA systematic method for analyzing failure modes/importance:Block diagram. Interfaces. Electrical, mechanical, thermal, clearance.Usually the problems are at the interfaces.System functions.Map each interface to the impact it has to a particular function.How could this interface go wrong. If it goes wrong, what would happen? Rate severity of failures. How likely it is to occur. How likely are you to detect it. Multiply the three numbers together and work from highest number to the lowest. Create a pareto list of what to attack.Usually the problems are temperature, moisture, vibration
