# SSCP - Wheels Sundae

# Wheels Sundae

Summary:

During the Sundae cycle, Stratysys manufactured eight more wheels. The designed was unchanged from Greg Hall's Luminos wheels. No changes were made mostly because the mechanical team was short on time. The eight wheels arrived in early June and were sent to be powder coated Candy Apple Red at A&E Elite Metal Finishing in San Jose. The cure temp was about 375 to 400 degrees F. We expect a 5-10% yield reduction after powder coating per calculations from the Luminos cycle. We could not find any ultra-low bake powder coating services in the area. The rationale for powder coating is that the scratch protection is worth the slight yield reduction.

Info on Luminos & Arctan wheels from Greg Hall:

1) Two lathe ops and a mill op. Theoretically starting with a forged pice would be better but it is obviously impractical.

2) They did some inspection to ensure the +/-.005in I specified. In particular they were very careful about fixing the lathe ops. I was very happy with the end result.

3) Material was not included and doubled the cost. We got it donated at the beginning of the cycle. Ask -Wes for details. It was 6061. That much 7075 would cost a fortune, and is a poor choice due to its worse fatigue properties. 6061 is a superior choice for this cyclic loading.

4) I am not confident the rim is optimally design from a strength to weight ratio due to our very conservative loading conditions. I also don't like the slight stress concentration in the thin walls by the lightning cutouts at the center.

5) The material has the longest lead time. It took 5+ weeks. The machining was a standard lead time of 3 weeks.

6) They were very concerned because due to waterjet kerf there was not much extra material and they were very worried about misaligning the stock on the first cut and not having enough material on one side. The lathing was delicate but they did not seem to have any problems, did not complain, and did a very nice job (in my opinion)Â 

They are a big shop though and I think the quality we got was mostly a function of the machinist assigned to the job.
