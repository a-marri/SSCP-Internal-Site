## SSCP - Tom Kenny 5/9

## Tom Kenny 5/9

Agenda:

Batteries -- how to work with Tesla/Panasonic? We want a few soon and a lot a year from now.

&#x20;   Even with 18650G should still be the same

&#x20;   People will look at it again, but should be the same contract

&#x20;   Stanford willing to intervene to make it work out again

&#x20;   Delivery early spring -- start process very beginning of fall quarter

&#x20;   \*\* if we need a few, try to avoid process

&#x20;       Tom Kenny can step in to help avoid any kind of fiasco if it looks like it's going to happen

EEE Electric Vehicles for High Schoolers

&#x20;   Not super important

&#x20;   Saying no

Summer funding 2017

&#x20;   SURI all from a single endowment

&#x20;       Historically always less than the endowment, but not anymore

&#x20;   Reach out in January (email Tom Kenny)

&#x20;       Tell him around December approximately how many

&#x20;   Coterms:

&#x20;       Can't use UAR funding

&#x20;       SoE is doing a lot of fundraising

&#x20;       Talk to Precourt Institute

Facilities: End Station 3

&#x20;   There's nothing for other groups that make sense for other groups

&#x20;   There's a small number of responsible, well organized student groups

&#x20;   Currently mostly storage

&#x20;   Also End Station 2 -- currently broken up into labs

&#x20;   He has submitted the application for space

&#x20;       Medium term -- prototype shared use space before building a new space

&#x20;   \*\* Stanford is currently renegotiating the square footage thing

&#x20;   Longterm: five years out a student group space that we could be involved in

Course credit for EE, MS\&E, Materials Science, Engineering Physics

&#x20;   Tom Kenny to email the relevant people

&#x20;   Engineering Physics is easy to do

Deadlines

&#x20;   Externally imposed deadlines are very useful

&#x20;       Cannot slip because it's not our idea

&#x20;   If people know deadlines will slip, it undermines the credibility

&#x20;   Just be honest -- it needs to happen, find something realistic

&#x20;       Engage people's preferences/input

&#x20;   "Never waste a crisis"
