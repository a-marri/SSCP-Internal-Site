# SSCP - Tom Kenny 5/9

# Tom Kenny 5/9

Agenda:

Batteries -- how to work with Tesla/Panasonic? We want a few soon and a lot a year from now.

    Even with 18650G should still be the same

    People will look at it again, but should be the same contract

    Stanford willing to intervene to make it work out again

    Delivery early spring -- start process very beginning of fall quarter

    ** if we need a few, try to avoid process

        Tom Kenny can step in to help avoid any kind of fiasco if it looks like it's going to happen

EEE Electric Vehicles for High Schoolers

    Not super important

    Saying no

Summer funding 2017

    SURI all from a single endowment

        Historically always less than the endowment, but not anymore

    Reach out in January (email Tom Kenny)

        Tell him around December approximately how many

    Coterms:

        Can't use UAR funding

        SoE is doing a lot of fundraising

        Talk to Precourt Institute

Facilities: End Station 3

    There's nothing for other groups that make sense for other groups

    There's a small number of responsible, well organized student groups

    Currently mostly storage

    Also End Station 2 -- currently broken up into labs

    He has submitted the application for space

        Medium term -- prototype shared use space before building a new space

    ** Stanford is currently renegotiating the square footage thing

    Longterm: five years out a student group space that we could be involved in

Course credit for EE, MS&E, Materials Science, Engineering Physics

    Tom Kenny to email the relevant people

    Engineering Physics is easy to do

Deadlines

    Externally imposed deadlines are very useful

        Cannot slip because it's not our idea

    If people know deadlines will slip, it undermines the credibility

    Just be honest -- it needs to happen, find something realistic

        Engage people's preferences/input

    "Never waste a crisis"
