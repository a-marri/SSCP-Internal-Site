# SSCP - Shivani 10/24

# Shivani 10/24

1.) Lift keys will now be stored by the van keys. After Wednesday she will let us know the new (probably the same as the old) policy on training. If it breaks while we are using it, we are liable -- so be careful.

2.) Safety trainings/shop access -- same process as last school year where anyone who goes through a general safety training and a lathe training can get access to the shop. They need to first get VAIL access with the online thing. She'll start hosting these trainings pretty soon.

4.) Erina wants a build cycle schedule/plan focusing on VAIL footprint and safety needs. I will run this by all of you before I send it to her as I want to be sure it's accurate.

5.) They want us to tell them if we plan to build an oven as soon as we can.

6.) Reiterated building security/close all windows/lock all doors thing. Let's not mess this up.

7. Shivani is going to work on getting us an outdoor storage shed. Annoyingly, we need to submit a proposal to the university facilities people and then they can approve/deny it, rather than them telling us what's possible. This will take the form of probably multiple ideas with different square footage and volume. Luckily, Erina and Shivani are both on our side on this one since they want us to get stuff out of the mech bay so it'll be clean -- so they'll be advocating for us.

8. Drumroll please... CNC training will just be demonstrating your ability to successfully set up, use, and clean the CNC unaided on a part of similar difficulty to what you will make for solar car. She'd like us to have a minimal number of people trained at any one time (unclear why) but responded reasonably to us saying we might need different people at different times and we don't know who yet. Anyone who passes the demonstration can be certified to use it at all times with no additional supervision or requirements; prior to passing the test, you can use it as much as you want under the supervision of someone who has proficiency (alums, etc)
