Array - Silicon vs. GaAs

Specs: 4.00 m^2 of Silicon vs. 3.56 m^2 of GaAs

Maximum quoted efficiencies: 24.3% for Si vs. 28.8% for GaAs

Expected best case efficiencies w/ encapsulation: 24.2% for Si vs 28.2% for GaAs (note: these are not solid numbers)

Total W from array assuming 1kW/sqm insolation (and no other losses): 968W for Si vs. 1002W for GaAs

That's a 34W difference, which translates roughly to a 35 minute race difference.

Additional Note: 37.9% efficiency for multijunction cells is necessary to be on par with GaAs.

Batteries - Li-ion vs. Li-Sulfur

Specs: 214 Wh/kg Li-ion vs. > 325 Wh/kg Li-Sulfur (most recent public quote - ongoing development)

Total weight allowed: 20kg Li-ion vs. 15kg Li-Sulfur

Resulting kWh of battery pack: 4280 kWh Li-ion vs. 4875 kWh Li-Sulfur

Diff: 595 Wh = 14% improvement using Li-Sulfur

This is a (roughly) 1.4% or 16W difference, which translates roughly to a 15-20 minute race difference.

Two additional benefits of Li-Sulfur cells is that they are:

1) they are capable of full discharge, where as Li-ion batteries are only used across ~80% of discharge range

2) they are MUCH safer, and can survive a nail test with barely a temperature or voltage fluctuation https://youtu.be/iUpwtKGAK0Y (so Stanford will be much happier with us, and we won't have to worry about battery fires like with Li-ion).
