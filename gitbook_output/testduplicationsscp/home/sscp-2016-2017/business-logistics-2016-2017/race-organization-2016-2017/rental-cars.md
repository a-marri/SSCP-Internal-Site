## Rental Cars

So looks like we won’t know for sure but we should get at least 1 SUV. If we want more, maybe we should reserve one as a backup option.

Hi Jim,

&#x20;

Unfortunately, being that these are captured fleet vehicles, there is no way of knowing exactly what will be in stock.  This was Holden’s response when I asked:

&#x20;

“We currently don’t know what vehicles we will have on our fleet that far in advance but we should be able to  accommodate 4 vehicles, one being an SUV/4x4 Utility vehicle and the rest being capable of seating four to five people.”

&#x20;

There are not many four seating vehicles, so most likely five, but a tight five seater for the sedans. As originally requested, you should be able to fit 18 for sure, and probably fit 20 if you wanted to fill every seat.  The SUV/4x4 will probably have 5-7 seats depending on what they are able to acquire. If you prefer the truck and they are able to get that, it would be 6 with a bench seat or 5 with a console.  I hope this helps and will continue to keep you in the loop as the timeline gets closer.

&#x20;

Best,

&#x20;

Hi Alex,

&#x20;

I hope you’ve been well and I was wondering if there are any updates about fleet vehicles in Australia? It would be great to know the cars that will be available soon because the total seats available will dictate the final number of traveling members and things like room reservations. I know the timeline is still early for partners in Australia, but a date that we would find out would also be helpful! Thanks so much.

&#x20;

Best,

Jim

&#x20;

1 four-door Colorado ute&#x20;

I looked briefly at RCO’s site, and I noticed they have a CNC department. We typically outsource machining parts for our suspension and if that’s something RCO is capable of doing, we would love to get in touch with them.&#x20;

Hi Jim,

&#x20;

I will ask Emily from Holden if she could pull as many SUVs as she can.  She will contact me when she knows what she is able to reserve for the team.

&#x20;

If you are looking for tools, then ACDelco may not be the right person to go to.  If you are looking for custom parts, I would recommend RCO Engineering.  They mostly do prototype tooling and small scale production in automotive, defense and aerospace companies.  They have a large shop next to GM and we work with them for some of our smaller production vehicles.  I can put you in contact with a contact I know there if interested.  Unfortunately, GM does not make tools in-house anymore, so I’m not sure how much we could get involved, but I will definitely look into it.  Regardless, let me know if you would like me to introduce you to my contact via email.   If not, feel free to reach out to them via website.

Hi Alex,

&#x20;

The dates we are looking for would be from September 1st to October 18th. Do you know if we would be able to request certain vehicles or when we would know the exact quantity and type? Larger cars with many seats would be ideal (4 cars total).

&#x20;

I will work on getting the final list of ACDelco parts, but since our design this year is slightly different and all of our parts will be made custom, the request would be mainly for ACDelco tools if that is alright.

&#x20;

Thanks again,

Hi Jim!

&#x20;

First off, Happy New Year!  Also, a big thank you from the mentors for the shirts and mugs!  Many of them were pleasantly surprised that the team was nice enough to send them out.

&#x20;

Now, good news – Australia has gotten back to me.  If you can send the date of arrival and departure (or your best estimate), we can reserve cars for you at GM Holden’s Fleet in the Port of Adelaide!  We will make sure there is at least one SUV with trailer abilities (possibly a truck).&#x20;

&#x20;

As for Maven, I was able to get in contact with a rep from the San Francisco group who is currently looking into it.  I will get back to you as soon as I hear something.

&#x20;

Lastly, for ACDelco parts, are there any parts you are looking to order soon?  If so, please send a list.

&#x20;

Hi Jim,

&#x20;

I’m sorry for the absence in communication.  I had a very busy couple of months here trying to get builds ready.  So you are looking to see if it’s possible to use Maven for May, June, & July and then would need Holden vehicles in Australia for August, September, & October?  Am I correct in those months?  I will be making a call to Australia soon to inform them with more information and get a preliminary line up of vehicles.  I am still waiting on Maven contacts to see what we can assist the team with.  Also, I can’t remember if I answered your question, but for the dollar value of the mentor time that some of the GM employees gave is generally $200/hour.  I believe you asked the question for sponsorship reasons, but that was the answer a GM rep was able to give me.  I believe we had 5 call sessions – I hope that helps!  Please nag me if you haven’t heard from me after the Holidays!

Hi Alex,

&#x20;

Thanks for the clarification on Maven. As for the dates, we would ideally start in the middle of May but the start of June is when we would definitely need them by. The team leaves for Australia in August, so the rental would be for roughly 3 months. I spoke with previous team members and it would be best to have the vehicles for prolonged amounts of time because the test drives and needs to travel can vary depending on the progress of the team – it’s hard to nail down specific dates. Also, outside of test drives they’ll also be very useful in picking up supplies and equipment in the area as well.

&#x20;

If renting for the entire 3 months would be difficult, we could also drop off/pick up at the Maven location once or twice during this period if that helps.

&#x20;

Best,

Jim

Hi Jim,

&#x20;

Maven is very new, so I would first suggest checking out the website to learn more about it.  There is a SF branch and I know they have SUVs to use.  Generally you can rent for a few days to a week, I am not sure how it works for months.  I can reach out to some contacts and see what we could possibly set up.  I will also reach out to other GM folks to see what kind of discount we could get the team.  However, I will be out of town next week so please be patient as I won’t be able to do much until the week of the 14th.  Basically, you sign up for Maven online and enter license and credit card info and then search for an available car for whatever days you would like to use it.  It is very new to California so bear with me as I work out trying to find discounts and deals for prolonged amounts of time.  As for estimates, I was looking for when you need to cars (which months) and for how long (days, weekends, months, etc.). I will follow back in a couple weeks time.

&#x20;

Best,

Hi Alex,

&#x20;

Maven sounds exciting, but we definitely have a few questions regarding the platform. Would we be able to use the car(s) for a prolonged period of time (i.e. 3-4 months leading up to the race)? Or would we have to return it after a certain period and pick it up again. Additionally I’d imagine we could create an account with credits to rent cars on – is that how it generally would work? Also what kind of estimates would you be looking for?

&#x20;

I touched base with Rachel and because the aero timeline is reaching completion, we won’t be needing additional aero input. It seems like we will no longer be needing Race car driving input either – sorry for the inconvenience there. Otherwise, I think everything is covered and I look forward to hearing of any updates about Australian cars and OEM parts when you find out.

Jim

Hi Jim,

&#x20;

So I spoke with some contacts today and the easiest way to get cars to you is for you to use Maven.  It recently launched in the Bay Area and we can look into covering costs if you can get some estimates to me.  There are usually SUVs available for use and it’s a great system to use that is both quick and reliable. https://www.mavendrive.com/#!/ Let me know if you have questions about it!

[https://www.mavendrive.com/#!/](https://www.mavendrive.com/#!/)

&#x20;

As for a previous question regarding monetary values to the meetings that the team has had over the summer with GM employees, the standard engineering consulting value is $200/hour.  I believe there were four meetings over the summer.  I also have found a racecar driver contact from GM that is available to talk with the team via WebEx.  He would be OK to call-in on a Saturday during the Solar Car meeting on November 9th, 10th or December 3rd.  Let me know if this time would work for those interested in learning about vehicle performance and racecar driving experience.

&#x20;

I was given approval to make calls to Australia and will be following up for an official answer on the vehicle rentals.  I am also working on finding out where we are on the OEM donations.  Please do not shy from reminding me of things that I may have forgotten!  It is a lot of people to keep track of and some things may slip my mind from time to time.   Also let me know if the team is looking to reschedule any of the meetings with the previous contacts.  I will attach a contact sheet for reference.  I know Rachel asked to have one of the meetings with aero engineers delayed until school started…is that someone you would still be interested in talking with?

Hi Alex,&#x20;

No worries. I will send the package to a single address since that’s easier. Also, we have new shirts on order because we realized not everyone at GM (and other companies) would want to wear a shirt with VW (or another competitor) showing prominently on their backs. Since the design will be different, we definitely would want to get you one as well - does the count below include your size? We are getting a proof of the shirt worked on now and you can probably expect to receive a package in a month or so (hopefully before the holidays for sure).&#x20;

&#x20;

Sounds good regarding the timeline for cars/parts. Just let me know if you think the domestic car(s) would be possible as well.

As for the shirts and mugs, GM appreciates the thought and gratefulness your team has shown.  It would most likely be easiest to send it to one address and I can hand them out to both the URT team as well as the engineer mentors.  For the shirts, I will list the number of sizes I collected.  Please do not go out of your way to reach the numbers below if you do not have them.  The mugs are awesome and I’m sure many would be very happy to fill their morning cup of joe with them!

Hi Alex,

&#x20;

I hope you had a good trip back to Michigan. It was great to meet you in person and thanks for stopping by the shop! Sorry for the slight disarray with all of the new members, but we really enjoyed having the chance to talk with the GM team. Also, please let us know how many of each size shirt the team would like along with an address so that we can send that soon (we'll also pack plenty of mugs)! Do you think it would be possible to get addresses of the engineers who helped our team as well? If not, we can always pack extra.

&#x20;

Additionally, thanks for the update regarding rental vehicles in Australia and ACDelco parts. We really appreciate your help with that and are excited that it looks almost confirmed at this point. I met with the team yesterday and we were wondering if it would be possible to have rental cars (like the Tiguan for Arctan) or rent fleet cars at a discount in America for test drives leading up to the race. We would ideally have a scout vehicle (Sonic Hatchback or Cruze/Malibu type) along with a larger car that could tow (Traverse/Tahoe type). Much like the Tiguan, I believe these vehicles would be able to sport larger GM/Chevy logos without an issue. Please let me know if this would be possible and hopefully the value can help get GM a large logo on our next car!&#x20;

&#x20;

Thanks again for your help.

Jim

Subject: GM Visit to Stanford

&#x20;

Hi Jim,

&#x20;

I wanted to let you know that GM will be at the career fair on Tuesday and anyone interested in potentially receiving an interview should stop by the booth to get a spot.  While we will be coming to VAIL on Wednesday, we may already have our interview spots lined up by then since our first day of interviews is Wednesday.  However, solar car members will also get more one-on-one time during our visit/presentation on Wednesday as well.  Just wanted to give a heads up!  I will be able to answer a lot more questions/concerns for the sponsorship on Wednesday too.  If you need to get a hold of me, you can reach me by the phone number (text or call) below or this email.

&#x20;

Look forward to seeing you!

&#x20;

Best,

&#x20;

Alex Archer

Design Release Engineer
