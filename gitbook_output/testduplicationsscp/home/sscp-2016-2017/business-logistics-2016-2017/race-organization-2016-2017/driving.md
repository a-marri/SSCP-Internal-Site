Lesson from Damian Harty from Lucite

* Single biggest thing you can do to drive more safely is to drive more attentivelyHumans can learn to do a lot of really difficult thingsNormal driving is in a linear region (turn steering wheel left = little bit left; turn steering wheel more left = more left)Danger comes in the nonlinear region -- it ambushes youHuman input is about 5HzPeople don't realize that the car can't keep up with them until the car is moving quickly and they try to respond quicklyHuman correction is very instinctiveVisualInner earSteer torqueIt takes people about 600ms to realize what's going onYou end up out of phase with the car's response when you're respondingThis leads to oscillation when the car starts to go out of controlInner ear can respond more quickly, but has limitationsDriver's in-head model of the car suggests the steering angle requiredYou've been learning how to reposition things to where you want since childhoodChanges in the resistance of the steering wheel elevates processing to more conscious levelsVery fast processing of unexpected responseOnly useful if you are ready to respond to it!People map the new size of a car's wheelbase within a few steers!What people don't do well is understand variable steering behaviorDefinitionsUndersteerLess tight of a circle than super basic geometry would expectSafer: see what you hit (good because cars are engineered for this)Also you stand a better possibility of getting out of it if you can regain controlOversteerMore tight of a circle than super basic geometry would expectWhich one occurs happens depending on whether the front or rear tires saturate = lose friction soonerDriving task has two componentsCommandLooking out the windscreen and deciding what to do"Path understeer" = car stops steering as much as you wantDriver tries steering more, but often the cause is temporary and when it regains traction it causes a spinCorrect response = let go of steering wheel and let off acceloratorControlManaging the attitude of the car and making sure it's doing the right thingPeople never think about this until they are in the middle of an accident!You will not learn proper handling of this until you've experienced it beforeResponse:Keep the car in the linear region (drive very carefully)Practice and learn how to handle itSmall slip changes are not noticed by driversSo when things start to change after being built up to for awhile the driver is still startledIf you can't track it, you don't notice you need to fix itIf you aren't comfortable and prepared to swerve accurately, stay steady when an object comes towards you, just brakeMost of the vehicles we're driving will be SUVs/trucks would not be able to dodge an object anywayYou will not be able to dodge things well without a lot of practice -- even professionals don't get double lane changes right every time!A lot of safe driving is about not putting yourself in a position where heroic moves are required to save youie don't go around corners blind, going into corners quickly is an accident waiting to happennot all people or all cars can do all things!
