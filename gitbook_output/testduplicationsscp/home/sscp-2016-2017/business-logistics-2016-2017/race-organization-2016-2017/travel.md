Being eligible to travel

* Make sure you're in good academic standing (not failing anything) at the end of this quarter. If you think you're at risk of failing, I highly recommend you drop the class -- it's better to have a not complete than a failing grade for Stanford travel eligibility, and the sooner you gain more time to devote to the team this quarter, the better!Do not confer your degree if you're "graduating" in the spring. You can be completely done with your degree and walk at graduation without officially graduating. The process is slightly different for different departments, but your advisor likely knows how this works. People often do this if they're planning to go on an overseas seminar or something, so it's not that unusual.Don't apply for housing for fall quarter by accident. You can submit the winter quarter housing application at the same time as the regular one, but it'll be a hassle for you and you may get charged if you back out of fall quarter housing too late.Submit a leave of absence form sometime this quarter or over the summer. It'll take some time to get all the signatures you need, but isn't too tricky, and has to be submitted before the quarter begins.Register your trip with the Stanford Office of International Affairs -- they'll send advice and help with disaster response. You can also read up on Stanford's recommendations here.

Travel to Australia

* It's always a good idea to be up to date on all vaccines before traveling. Darwin is in the tropics which technically carries with it all of the normal risks of tropical diseases, but historically for the team this hasn't been an issue. If you're concerned (or if other places you plan to travel post-race are at higher risk), Vaden has a travel clinic that can help you out.You'll need to get a visa to enter Australia, but it's super easy for Americans and you can do it online. You likely want to apply for this one. The same website also has a handy search tool if you aren't a US citizen and need to apply for something different.

General Tips

* Start thinking about your post-race travel early! Places book up (especially New Zealand) and you may have to apply for more complicated visas for other countries.Everyone should have a backpacking backpack and a smaller daypack. To make this small amount of gear more tractable, it might be a good idea to get an easily compressed sleeping bag, small travel towels, etc. If you need to shop around for any of these things, start watching sales now.It's generally a good idea to insure a big trip like this. I used STA Travel in 2015 -- not too expensive and covers the basics. Buying flights with certain credit cards can include some of this, too, but often it's limited to shorter trips. For example, my card only covers trips where you return to the US within 60 days :(You'll need to make sure your phone works in Australia or get a phone that does. We need to be able to contact you so just relying on free wifi where you can find it will be insufficient. T-mobile works internationally for text and data but I think most others don't.

Expectations

* Going to Australia with the team is fun, but it'll also be grueling. Take care of yourself and make sure you stay hydrated and get enough sleep. Fatigue and dehydration are no joke, especially when we're going to be doing so much driving, and it'll be dangerous for everyone if drivers are too tired. Make sure you always know which tasks of yours need to get done and prioritize them -- it could be easy to get sucked into running errands or helping other people so your stuff doesn't get done and you need to work all night, which will not be acceptable during test drives and the race. Crawling into the tent four hours after everyone else has gone to sleep will not make you popular.Before the race: When in Adelaide and Darwin, remember that you're there to contribute to the team, not to be a tourist. Last cycle we had problems with people going out at night in Adelaide and then being exhausted the next day when we needed to get things done (it's tempting -- Adelaide has some great bars and other solar car teams will be there -- but we'll have time for that after the race).After the race: you can't leave Adelaide before the packdown area closes as we'll need hands to help pack everything up. If everyone sticks around and contributes a few hours, the rest of us can do fun things -- last cycle, people went to the beach, a wildlife park, wine tasting, etc, and no one had to put in absurd hours to get the car packed up.The team will provide the basics you need to survive, but not everything you need. Meals will be basic and constrained by what is feasible when camping in a large group for extended periods of time, and what's available in Australia may not be the same as what you'd expect here (for example, last time we were surprised that canned chicken is just not a thing). The biggest conflict point was meat, as the canned meat most available is tuna and Spam, and beef jerky was expensive. Meat in general is expensive, and the team can provide a lot more food when the protein is mostly beans and peanut butter. Be prepared to buy more food for yourself if you don't like a particular meal or need more.Typical meals for a day in the Outback:Breakfast = instant coffee, cornflakes, cheerios, milk, bread, peanut butter and nutellaLunch = peanut butter sandwiches packed at breakfast, chips or other snacky foods, mini oranges or carrots if we've been to a place with fresh produceDinner = canned green beans, quick-cook rice noodles, canned tunaIn Adelaide/Darwin, the food is better, but still not fancy since the team has a strict food budget. Lots of people went out to eat or cooked for themselves in the cities, but the team did make meals. They were basically better versions of the same thing -- fresh produce instead of canned, sandwiches with better toppings than pb & j, etcIt's critical that everyone pack light, since we have a lot of people and not a ton of space. Last cycle, a few people brought more stuff that they needed for their post-race travel and they left that in a storage unit in Adelaide, which is an option. It's pretty cheap since a lot of places have introductory first-month rates that are really low. If you bring more than the two backpacks described above your teammates will be annoyed and you'll probably hate yourself by the end of the trip too because it's a pain to lug it all around.Don't keep the rest of the team waiting for you! During the race departures will be very prompt and you WILL be left behind. During test drives and in cities things will also be busy and we'll try to make timing well known.The team will get a wifi access point that turns cellphone data into internet. You can use this to check email and such, but no Spotify or Netflix as we will pay for data usage. We'll likely ask anyone using it to do non-team stuff to pay in, but it'll be pretty cheap.Reading emails/slack will be increasingly important. There's a lot of logistics that have to be worked out, and we'll give you all of the information you need, but if you don't read it it'll be your own damn fault and the team will not bail you out. Examples that could be problematic include not renewing a passport, not getting a phone that works in Australia, forgetting you needed to buy your own food, etc. We told you.

If you bring more than the two backpacks described above your teammates will be annoyed and you'll probably hate yourself by the end of the trip too because it's a pain to lug it all around.
* Don't keep the rest of the team waiting for you! During the race departures will be very prompt and you WILL be left behind. During test drives and in cities things will also be busy and we'll try to make timing well known.
* The team will get a wifi access point that turns cellphone data into internet. You can use this to check email and such, but no Spotify or Netflix as we will pay for data usage. We'll likely ask anyone using it to do non-team stuff to pay in, but it'll be pretty cheap.
* Reading emails/slack will be increasingly important. There's a lot of logistics that have to be worked out, and we'll give you all of the information you need, but if you don't read it it'll be your own damn fault and the team will not bail you out. Examples that could be problematic include not renewing a passport, not getting a phone that works in Australia, forgetting you needed to buy your own food, etc. We told you.

* Going to Australia with the team is fun, but it'll also be grueling. Take care of yourself and make sure you stay hydrated and get enough sleep. Fatigue and dehydration are no joke, especially when we're going to be doing so much driving, and it'll be dangerous for everyone if drivers are too tired. Make sure you always know which tasks of yours need to get done and prioritize them -- it could be easy to get sucked into running errands or helping other people so your stuff doesn't get done and you need to work all night, which will not be acceptable during test drives and the race. Crawling into the tent four hours after everyone else has gone to sleep will not make you popular.
* Before the race: When in Adelaide and Darwin, remember that you're there to contribute to the team, not to be a tourist. Last cycle we had problems with people going out at night in Adelaide and then being exhausted the next day when we needed to get things done (it's tempting -- Adelaide has some great bars and other solar car teams will be there -- but we'll have time for that after the race).
* After the race: you can't leave Adelaide before the packdown area closes as we'll need hands to help pack everything up. If everyone sticks around and contributes a few hours, the rest of us can do fun things -- last cycle, people went to the beach, a wildlife park, wine tasting, etc, and no one had to put in absurd hours to get the car packed up.
* The team will provide the basics you need to survive, but not everything you need. Meals will be basic and constrained by what is feasible when camping in a large group for extended periods of time, and what's available in Australia may not be the same as what you'd expect here (for example, last time we were surprised that canned chicken is just not a thing). The biggest conflict point was meat, as the canned meat most available is tuna and Spam, and beef jerky was expensive. Meat in general is expensive, and the team can provide a lot more food when the protein is mostly beans and peanut butter. Be prepared to buy more food for yourself if you don't like a particular meal or need more.Typical meals for a day in the Outback:Breakfast = instant coffee, cornflakes, cheerios, milk, bread, peanut butter and nutellaLunch = peanut butter sandwiches packed at breakfast, chips or other snacky foods, mini oranges or carrots if we've been to a place with fresh produceDinner = canned green beans, quick-cook rice noodles, canned tunaIn Adelaide/Darwin, the food is better, but still not fancy since the team has a strict food budget. Lots of people went out to eat or cooked for themselves in the cities, but the team did make meals. They were basically better versions of the same thing -- fresh produce instead of canned, sandwiches with better toppings than pb & j, etc
