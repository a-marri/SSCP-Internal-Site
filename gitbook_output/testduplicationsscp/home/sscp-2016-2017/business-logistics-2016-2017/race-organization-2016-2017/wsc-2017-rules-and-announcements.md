Big Changes:

* At control stops, array normalization must be actuated by the driver only.
* Driver must be contained within an "Occupant Cell" that can take a certain amount of force.
* Array size has decreased.  3.56m^2 of GaAs may be better than 4m^2 of Si.
* Vehicle can be 5m long, 2.2m wide, 1.6m high, giving aero a bit more freedom.
* Li-S cells are explicitly allowed, have much higher energy density than Li-ion.
* "Primary Braking System" needs to stop all four wheels.
* Car must have 2m^2 of "storage" space.
* Driver needs wider range of vision.
* Side-indicator lights required.
* Different dynamic scrutineering requirements -- required turn radius may actually be longer than last cycle.

Array size has decreased.  3.56m^2 of GaAs may be better than 4m^2 of Si.

Vehicle can be 5m long, 2.2m wide, 1.6m high, giving aero a bit more freedom.

Li-S cells are explicitly allowed, have much higher energy density than Li-ion.

"Primary Braking System" needs to stop all four wheels.

Car must have 2m^2 of "storage" space.

Driver needs wider range of vision.

Side-indicator lights required.

Different dynamic scrutineering requirements -- required turn radius may actually be longer than last cycle.

Need Clarification:

(2.3.4) What qualifies as 2m^2 storage space?

---- Ask WSC.

(2.11.5) How do we "certify" our "Occupant Cell"?

---  Ask Alumni.

(2.21.2) What constitutes "primary braking system"?

--- Think about more, then ask.
