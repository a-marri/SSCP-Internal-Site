3.18 Energy Collection

* (.3) Cannot use ground sheets, etc -- not allowed to have external stuff

3.26 Control Stops

* "Teams may not spray water on the solar collector during the 30 minutes of the control stop."
* Spray?
* Not water?
* Previously: they said "you may cool using this specific method" now say "may not cool using the same method"
* And at start and end of day can cool however we want
* Control stop timing starts and ends when no one touches it anymore
* Driver can reconfigure, but time spent reconfiguring means not part of 30 minutes
* Solar car can reconfigure itself!
* Don't actively say you can't reconfigure, just that you can't touch itSticks?Remote control?Would that count as part of the car
* Sticks?
* Remote control?Would that count as part of the car
