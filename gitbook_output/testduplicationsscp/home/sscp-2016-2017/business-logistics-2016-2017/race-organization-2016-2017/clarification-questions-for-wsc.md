Approaching WSC officials; feedback from Darren Chen:

It says you can demonstrate compliance with documentation confirmed by the certifying engineer, which is not that difficult. You just have to design to meet the UNECE requirements (visibility angles, brightness, etc) then show the documentation that proves this to someone like Dorian, who can sign it for you. These documents would be like CAD models of the sectors the lights are visible and distance vs brightness testing. The key is that you don't actually have to get UNECE certified, which would be pretty much impossible for a solar car team. 

For suspension and roll cage stuff you need to show the design calculations like FEA simulations of their performance and actually show Dorian around the car. He will point out any problems (hopefully there are none by then) and pretty much give a "looks alright" approval if it seems OK. It is not that difficult if you have kept design reviews and checks as the car was being designed and built, as no new surprises should show up if many people have looked over it. Food for thought: some strong opinions in the SSCP alum would have never approved a carbon fiber roll cage for the Arctan cycle, while Michigan and others approved it etc. "Certification" differs wildly from team to team. 

One thing that I feel is important to share is despite how daunting and imposing the rules may seem in the beginning, they are actually quite flexible. I think alot of the rules are just WSC covering their own backs in case of something going wrong. The crash simulations they require of teams are simply too complex to run with meaningful results for pretty much any team. We asked Michael for help with our crash simulations but we could just as easily pass or fail the requirements depending on how we set up the simulation, and this is with SpaceX (SpaceX- you simulate one single strut and sometimes your answer is 10x off predicted, so you calibrate with real testing and iterate. Here we have a whole car chassis assembly) level composites simulation experience. The Thai or high school teams simply cannot do this yet WSC will pass their "simulations" anyways. 

Last year WSC also changed the rollcage requirement to pass a drop simulation from 1 meter (something like that). That is difficult to simulate and we did not think that rule was reasonable so I sent them our 5g load simulations with a note saying our team has designed all of our cars with 5g load simulations and even had a car flip and survive, so we were going to simulate to 5g. They accepted our documentation without a quip. 

What I am saying is don't get too worried about the certification if you have built a good car that meets the requirements in good faith. The truly sketchy cars that start the race then catch on fire all had certification that passed WSC. WSC just wants to say somebody looked over your work, and it's not their fault if something goes wrong. The certifications for our car are supposed to be done by a certified engineer, of which Dorian is not, and he tells you this while he signs it and crosses out the certified part. As you know already know, WSC does not care. 

So focus your effort on designing a good, safe, car, and heed design review feedback etc. Submit the certifications that they ask for (and submit on time), but don't get too stressed out about it because it's more about your car being decent then them actually enforcing the paperwork. Even when you're in direct violation of the rules, like the WSC logo on the front of our car being blatantly the wrong shape and size, it can come down to sweet talking and fandangling on the scrutineering floor that determines what passes and what doesn't.
