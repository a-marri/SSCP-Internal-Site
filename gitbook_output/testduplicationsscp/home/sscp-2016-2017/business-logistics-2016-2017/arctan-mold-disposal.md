## Arctan Mold Disposal

Since they were used to construct the Arctan aerobody, the molds were stored outside and had holes drilled in them at the low points to drain water.

VAIL has wanted us to get rid of the molds as soon as we got back from Australia. We can give them away or destroy them. Much better to give them to a high school team. We maintained the policy that the first team to show up gets the molds.

It should cost no more than $5,000 to truck the molds anywhere in the continental United States. This statement is likely true. We have quoted shipping the solar car from Stanford to North Carolina with FedEx (not cheapest company) for $3,750.

Harmony Science Academy of San Antonio, TX approached us first but seemed to know very little about what would actually be involved. They has less than four day turn-around between first contact with an experience member of their team and showing up with a pick-up truck, trailer, and forklift. See attached image.

Liberty Christian School of Argyle, TX approached us second but with more planning. At first they were going to use a parent's trucking company, then UPS.

There was some confusion about the forklift; initially Harmony booked the shipping company to bring their own forklift, but then canceled that and did not book an alternative. Ultimately, I (Kelsey) spent much of the morning finding a rental company that could get a forklift to VAIL quickly because the shipping truck was already there; it was billed to Harmony. In the future, make sure it is abundantly clear that they need to provide their own forklift.
