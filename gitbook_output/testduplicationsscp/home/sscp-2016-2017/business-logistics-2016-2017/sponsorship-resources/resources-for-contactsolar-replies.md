A few sources that have been hugely helpful for us:

The Leading Edge (http://www.amazon.com/The-Leading-Edge-Engineering-Performance/dp/0837608600) is a book that we used to help learn about aerodynamics.

A Solar Car Primer (2015 version) is a book I haven't read, but I've heard is extremely useful for solar car design, and reading it will help you immensely. http://www.amazon.com/Solar-Car-Primer-Construction-Solar-Powered/dp/3319174932

Finally, here are a few random resources that team members have pointed new members on our team to in the past to learn about solar car racing: http://solarcar.wikia.com/wiki/Reference\_Documents is a wiki that has lots of good resources, and http://www.cs.cmu.edu/\~15712/papers/mythicalmanmonth00fred.pdf was recommended as a good resource on design principles for software engineering.&#x20;
