# SSCP - Siemens

# Siemens

I reached out to Jim Phelan initially, he transferred me to Dora Smith and had us submit a grant application. Now that the relationship is established, all future communications should be routed through Bijy Vattathara. We have 25 seats on NX and 5 on Fibersim. Renewal fee annually is $5,300 for both. Number of seats do not impact the renewal fee.

Contracts, donation information and initial email chain are below
