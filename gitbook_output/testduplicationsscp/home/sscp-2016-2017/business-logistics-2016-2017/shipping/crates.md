# Crates

Call on 7/10: they want 12" in each x/y/z dimension for strength

Hi Clare, 

Based on car dimensions of 158x63x48" High, the discounted rate including delivery and ISPM15 compliant wood crate is $1084.52.  Please keep in mind, this will be a large crate (estimated crate dims: 161x66x55"H) and will need to deliver to a site with a truck high loading dock. Otherwise, you will need a forklift to offload.  Please let me know if you have any questions.  Thank you. 

Regards,

William Cannon

Hi William,

Thank you so much! We do not require labor for packing crating the car - we'll do that bit ourselves.

We will however need delivery of the crate. I'm happy to answer any other questions you have, and will look forward to seeing the rate!

Hi William,

Just wanted to follow up and see if this seems possible, or if there are other considerations we should have in mind.

Let me know! 

Thanks,

Hi William,

Wonderful! Thank you so much. For this cycle, we're interested in a large crate to hold both the car and then with a compartment below to hold accessories for the car. The car is approximately 4m high x 1.6m wide x 1.2m tall, so something to hold this safely and then a compartment underneath for accessories would be ideal. Let me know if this seems possible!

Thanks,

Clare

Hi Clare,

Yes we can assist with a custom crate.  We have done so in the past; a relatively small crate for the parts and accessories of the car.  Do you need something similar or a large crate for the entire car?  Do you have estimated inside or outside dimensions of the crate you have in mind? Thanks!

Regards,

William Cannon

Hi William,

Sorry for the long delay. We have begun constructing the car, laying up our custom aerobody and continuing work on logistics.

Thank you very much for your continued offer of sponsorship. This cycle we are not as in need of help with transportation, but were were wondering if you would be willing to help sponsor a custom shipping crate solution for our car. Would this be possible?

Let me know,

Thanks!

Clare

Thanks Tandy.

Please share any other images or material that you think will help us in our marketing efforts.  

Last year's donation, we supplied flat bed transportation from Stanford to LA at a deep discount, provided our foreman with onsite assistance with the truck loading, and managing the shipment to ensure timely delivery to the port for sailing to Australia.  

Please let us know if this will be helpful for this year’s project.  Thank you.

Hi Clare,

The reason we are asking for pictures is for our internal marketing purposes (FB, Instagram, our website, etc). Do you have a more clear picture or more close of last year's car with possibly our logo more visible for marketing purposes?

And yes, we plan to sponsor this year with similar donation as last year.  Many thanks in advance.

William Cannon

Hi William,

Thank you so much for your interest! As the current car is not yet built, we will not be designing the exterior vinyl until the summer as one of the last stages of the process. However, attached is a picture of last cycle's car Arctan and where generally the logo will go. As you can see on Arctan, all logos on the car are proportional to the size of donation. We would value the size of your donation to the market value of the service provided to us.

<SSCP_Logo.jpg>

For instance, GEICO in the upper right hand corner of the leftmost section was in the Silver level of donation ($5,000-19,999), Gonsel's Machine shop was a Gold level sponsor ($20,000-39,999), and 3M was a Platinum Level sponsor ($40,000-79,999). Diamond level sponsorships ($80,000+) would have an even larger logo on the car.

The logo would also be on the outside of the trailer, with same proportions as above tiers, and for bronze level donations (below $5,000) would be the only place the logo would physically appear.

<Trailer.jpg>

Thank you so much, and I'm happy to answer any other questions you may have.

Best Regards,

Hi William,

Just wanted to follow up in case you hadn't had the chance to respond to the below email. 

***

My name is Clare Tandy, and I’m a business officer on the Stanford Solar Car Project. Thank you for the lovely holiday card that you sent us! We appreciate hearing from you.

As you know, we’re one of the largest student groups at Stanford, committed to designing, building, and racing a solar powered car over 1,800 miles through the Australian Outback at the World Solar Challenge in October 2017.

As we approach the race, we're looking for a company to sponsor and build a custom, international compliant crate to air ship our vehicle to Australia. Our sponsors are prominently displayed on our car, uniforms, and trailer; enjoy international exposure in our marketing, social media, and news outlets; and are afforded private recruiting access to Stanford’s most tenacious engineers. Current supporters of our project include Ford, SpaceX, Qantas, Siemens, SunPower, and more.

I know you must be busy, so I’ve attached our brochure in the interest of keeping this email short. Please let me know if you see potential for a partnership or have any questions about our team. I’m available any time by by email at ctandy@stanford.edu or by phone at (408) 859-3300. We look forward to hearing from you!
