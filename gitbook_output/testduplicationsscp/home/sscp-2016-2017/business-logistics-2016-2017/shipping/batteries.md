Ok we'll think about that, it's doable. What are your thoughts on air shipping the battery crate if the battery packs are UN3481

You cannot fly the big one as configured, 48” x 60” x 72” LxWxH, as it is too tall.

You can fly it if configured 48” x 72” x 60” LxWxH,

Can you get quotes for flying them? Battery flyability seems sketchy, but the big crate would be fine

That is the fastest ocean transit I see at this time.

Hi Michael,

Door-to-port is great. How long will it take for our crates to clear customs (aka total door to port shipping time). We need them any time in the first week of September, so we’re trying to figure out the latest ship out date from here.

Here are the answers to your questions:

What are the pick up and delivery addresses?

- 473 Oak Road, Stanford, CA

- Port Adelaide, specifics tbd/flexible

Are the pick up and delivery locations commercial or residential? 

Both are commercial

Do you have means of loading and unloading at pickup and delivery? 

Forklifts can be arranged with sufficient warning

Description of items shipping in each package

Crate 1: two custom Panasonic-approved 5kwh battery packs

Crate 2: diesel generator, camping supplies (tents/camp stove/tarps/etc), spare tires, tape, various power tools

Packaging, Crates

Professional-built crates by Craters & Freighters out of import-compliant wood.

Dimensions of each package

*** these are internal -- how thick will the crates be?

Crate 1: 36” x 48” x 54”

Crate 2: 48” x 60” x 72”

Weight of each package

Crate 1: 100kg

Crate 2: 200 kg

(note: weights are approximate and contingent on weight of empty crate, still pending)

Thanks,

Roman

We do ship to Australia Door-to-Port, but not Door-to-Door.

All Duties, Taxes, and Fees are due COD from the receiving party before the freight will be released.

If that meets your needs, please provide the following so I may provide you an initial quote:

Hi Michael,

Do you handle international boat shipping? We need to ship two crates to Australia the first week of august. One is large and will contain a bunch of equipment and the other is smaller but will be hazardous goods because it's going to carry two of our UN 3841 lithium ion battery packs.

Thanks!

We have shipped the batteries via ocean shipping multiple times in the past. Could you look into that again? It is definitely possible, but we understand that it is not easy.

Is there any way to via the sailing schedule in advance? We cannot book without knowing the full range of options as time is very tight.

Hi Roman,

I recommend all go via air. Ocean shipping is very slow and can compromise your deadline. Looks like our office in Melbourne, Australia will be able to assist with clearing and delivering your cargo under your name. I am waiting for just a couple more details to make sure we have everything covered door to door. Can you give me an address for delivery, Since the Airfreight cannot go directly to Adelaide due to the commodity we will need to send it somewhere for you to collect.

Best regards,

Hi Roman,

Someone must be the Shipper and there must be a consignee at the other end. The consignee is typically the importer on the other end. The importer will need to be registered in the receiving country and take care of any applicable duties of taxes.
