Morning Kelsey,

&#x20;

We’re glad to hear that you would be interested in trying out our tires for the 2017 race.&#x20;

Your team is one of the three in North America that we are interested in supporting with our new tires.

&#x20;

So, to get things started I would like to virtually introduce to Andrew Carey.

Andrew is coordinating our North American tire sponsorship for the 2017 Bridgestone World Solar Challenge.

&#x20;

Andrew,

&#x20;

Would you please let Kelsey know the next steps that the Stanford team needs to take so we can get them some test tires?

&#x20;

Best regards,

&#x20;

Gandhi

&#x20;

Kelsey,

&#x20;

I’m happy to hear Stanford is interested in utilizing Bridgestone’s solar car tires for WSC.

&#x20;

I worked with Guillermo Gomez for the 2015 race but your team ultimately used the Michelin tires, so I am not sure how much information has been passed on to you. Would you be available in the morning on Friday for a brief teleconference to talk about the tire program and Stanford’s upcoming tire needs?

&#x20;

Thanks.

&#x20;

Kelsey,

&#x20;

I apologize for how long this has taken, but attached you will find the 2017 WSC NDA. Once we get this signed, we can begin providing your team with tires for any pre-race testing.

&#x20;

Let me know if you have any questions. Thanks.

Hi Andrew,

Sorry for the delay in getting this back to you -- it's been finals week here at Stanford! Thanks for your patience.

Please find the signed NDA attached. What are the next steps in this process?

Thanks, and happy holidays!

Hi,

Sorry for such a long delay -- things have been crazy around the holidays.

We will likely go through three sets of tires prior to the race and three more sets during the race. Of course, we will evaluate the tires during testing before we select our race tires. We are also working to acquire some Michelin tires for consideration and will be testing both formulations under the same conditions so we can be sure to use the best tires for our purposes.

to me

Kelsey,

&#x20;

I completely understand the desire to evaluate performance of both brands prior to locking in a tire. However, we typically limit our support to 1 set for competitive comparison, due to limited quantities of tires available. Is 1 set sufficient to confirm whether your team will go forward with Bridgestone or Michelin?

&#x20;

Thanks.

&#x20;

Hi Andrew,

I've conferred with the team and we think we will need three sets of tires to perform the tests we have designed for tire evaluation. Would that be acceptable?

Thanks,

Kelsey

Kelsey,

&#x20;

I have reviewed our tire availability for testing, and I feel we are able to support your team’s needs.

&#x20;

Would greatly like to work with your team for 2017 WSC and future races. To support a potential future partnership, would it be possible to schedule a visit with your team to discuss the vehicles needs and how we may be able to support going forward? I believe sometime the week of March 13th would be a potential week we could schedule to meet, if your availability allows as well.

&#x20;

Thanks and I look forward to future discussions.

&#x20;

-Andrew

Hi Andrew,

The week of March 13th should work for us. When would you be interested in visiting? Our regular meeting is Wednesday at 7:30pm if you'd like to come by and see the entire team, but if that doesn't work for you we can find another time.

Kelsey,

&#x20;

I believe that Wednesday would be a good opportunity to visit. Please let me circle back around with my Japanese counterparts to firm up a schedule and then I will get back with you.

&#x20;

Also, I’m not sure where your team is at with your vehicle build, but let me know when you would like the tire sets so I can ensure we get them out to you in time.

&#x20;

Thanks.

Hi,

Just let me know when you would like to come by!

We will start testing tires as soon as the car is drivable, which will likely be June or early July. There's no rush.
