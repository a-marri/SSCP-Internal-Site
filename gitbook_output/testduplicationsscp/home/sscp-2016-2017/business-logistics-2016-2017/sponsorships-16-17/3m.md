NOTES:

Hello,

The Stanford Solar Car Project has been receiving support from 3M through product donations for many years. 3M has been a major sponsor of our project since 2011 and we have received invitations from Jill Sjodin to participate in the educational giving program yearly. We have not received an invitation yet this year and wanted to reach out to begin the product donation process. Please let me know of next steps and I appreciate your help.

Best,

(NAME)

Click the link in the email and fill out the form to receive login information for the donation portal - once submitted you will receive login information (see 2nd email below). The initial products they offered weren't enough for us and I asked Jill is we can order more...she said we could add 3 products (3/09/16):

3/28/16 Received login credentials (YOU WILL NEED YOUR OWN - THIS IS JUST FOR REFERENCE):

We tried adding our own items we wanted in our initial request and got denied. Please see attached files for the original offering they gave us the 3 additional item spreadsheet template and what they actually ended up giving us.

When filling out the product donation through the portal, you can look at previous applications to see how you should fill the forms out.

We ended up receiving the materials in late July/early August I think.

November/2016: Received an email to fill out and mail in Donation receipt acknowledgment form (for 3M tax purposes) FILL THIS OUT PROMPTLY AND SEND BACK

Below files are only for reference, you will most likely receive new product offers
