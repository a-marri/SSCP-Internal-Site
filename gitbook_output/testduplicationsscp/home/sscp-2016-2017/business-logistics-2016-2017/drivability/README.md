# Drivability

CalSol: registers as a self-made car, which is super illegal (have to lie and say you make it according to all regulations)

Options

* Least nice: surrender the current registration and then register the car for driving on track only
* Provision in CA vehicle code for low speed vehicle — up to 25mph; could qualify and get licensed; can drive on public roads with low speed limit
* 49 USC 30114 — Secretary of Transportation may exempt any car for research, show and display or races
* 49 CFR 555 Path for temporary exemption for research — regularly used by automotive companies (not clear if it can be used for anything besides manufacturers)
* In 2015: small manufacturers (less than 325 cars per year) of replica vehicles don’t have to meet requirements
* Ideal case: establish a path for vehicles constructed for particular races to be judged based on their respective rules requirements (perhaps with other requirements like shift of liability, etc)
