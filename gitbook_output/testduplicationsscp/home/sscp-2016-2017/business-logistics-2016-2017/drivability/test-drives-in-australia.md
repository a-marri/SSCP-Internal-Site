Hello,

I am writing to inquire about the steps our team (Stanford) needs to take to allow us to test drive on the Stuart Highway prior to the race this fall. Before BWSC in both 2013 and 2015 we found testing on the actual road we race on extremely valuable for our team and our drivers. As the new rules for this cycle specify that teams must go through WSC officials, rather than working directly with the South Australian government as our team has in the past, we would very much appreciate any steps you can provide.

Let me know if you have any questions for me about our previous testing on the Stuart Highway, our reasons for planning our testing this way, or anything else.

Hi Kelsey,

We are unable to provide any update on the question of road testing which remains under discussion with the relevant authorities. &#x20;

If a protocol for entrants to access public roads without the supervision of event officials can be negotiated, the process and conditions will be announced to all registered team managers.

Please let me know if you have any further questions.

Kind regards,

Hello,

Thanks for getting back to me.

Do you have any idea of the timeline for when you will know what the rules for this will be? We are currently planning to arrive in Australia on 1 September to conduct three weeks of race-simulation testing, as we have in the past. If we will not be able to drive on public roads in South Australia, we need to know as soon as possible so we can make other arrangements for testing elsewhere.

I also just wanted to express how important this kind of testing has become to our team in particular. Last cycle we drove two full WSC lengths prior to the race and we feel it is indispensable experience for our drivers and race crew to do this. Please let me know if there's anything the Stanford team can do to help move the process for South Australian road testing forward. If a testimony about our safety procedures, use of the road, or other previous experience test driving prior to the race would help, we would be happy to provide it.

Thanks,

Kelsey Josund

Hi Kelsey,

We are unable to provide a definitive answer or timeline on the subject of Road Testing. However, we will be looking into this further in the coming months.&#x20;

Driving a home made car on public roads is a contentious issue in Australia which is compounded by the conditions of the import permit that we must obtain for your vehicle.

For your general information approval to import a vehicle to Australia is a federal matter, but the permission to use a vehicle on a public highway is a matter for individual states.  As a generalisation, a vehicle that does not have a recognised compliance plate is unlikely to either gain import approval or access to public roads.

We have precedent that the South Australian Authorities have accepted the Roadworthiness Certificate for solarcars that are registered to participate in the event (Regulation 2.10.2 refers) as the basis to grant a conditional unregistered vehicle permit allowing testing northbound on the Stuart Highway between Glendambo and the NT border and anticipate that similar arrangements can be made for 2017.&#x20;

The Northern Territory authorities have, in the past, required a physical roadworthiness inspection to be conducted in Darwin before granting access to designated sections of public road. &#x20;

Both SA and NT authorities impose conditions on this access.  Unfortunately some past teams have chosen not to comply with the conditions which came with a road testing permit which makes it difficult to show that we are a responsible community.

Once a protocol for entrants to gain pre-event access to public roads can be negotiated, the process and conditions will be announced to all registered team managers.  See also section 3.10 of the Regulations.

We appreciate your offer for assistance in this matter and we hope to give you more information as soon as we can.

Kind regards,

Hello logistics people past and recent,

I'm getting fairly concerned about test driving in Australia, given the comments from WSC below. It's too early to panic right now, but things aren't looking super positive as far as SA testing. Maybe it'll come through just fine, but no matter what it sounds like it's out of our control, so I'd like to come up with a contingency plan.

Do any of you have advice for dealing with WSC or alternative testing locations  should things fall through? Something that would be a better proxy for the Stuart Highway than the Central Valley is. I was thinking maybe investigating Western Australian highways should SA and NT be unwilling to work with us, but I'm not sure how we have historically initiated conversations with state governments in the past.

Thanks for your thoughts and advice!

to me

It is tough for me to tell what the WSC officials will arrange for you all based on their emails below. It seems like they are providing context without commitments. It looks like you have a reasonably good chance of still being able to drive in South Australia, but it would be wise to know what your best backup option is in the event that South Australia testing falls through.&#x20;

I’ve only arranged special testing in South Australia, so I’m not sure what you would need to do to test in New South Wales, Queensland, or Victoria. Going to Western Australia seems really out of the way. Is there a reason why you mentioned that particular territory? Western Australia also has few roads that take you anywhere practical for the race. At least in NSW and Queensland you can still eventually make your way towards Darwin.

Have you reached out to some of the Australian solar car alumni living in the Bay Area? I could give you introductions if you want to ask them for their advice on places to test or how to deal with local officials in the other territories.

Thanks for getting back so quickly!

Yeah, WSC just sounds very noncommittal which is why I'm concerned. It could be fine.

I mentioned Western Australia because I know a huge chunk of it is very Outback. I guess a decent amount of other states/territories is the same way, though. If I were to pursue that route I'd look into all of the others.

How did you start talking with SA originally, do you recall? (What kind of job title is the email/phone number you looked for or had success with?) An introduction to any alums in Australia you have contact for would be very helpful.

Thanks!

I can’t recall how exactly I got in contact with South Australia originally, but I can send you my contact details.&#x20;

I’ll introduce you to some alumni.

to me

My thoughts on this took me a while to write down in email, apologies for a delay. Won't be able to write a long email but I think in general you should avoid trying to negotiate one-on-one with any government in Australia. Every level of government you care about should know about the race. Those governments/regions who have never heard of it or dealt with it will likely be too remote for you to test in. The Stanford team doesn't have as much negotiating power as top-top teams (no offense to anyone) and if they try to negotiate one-on-one it won't be good for others unless wSC generalizes. The way I see it you're better off forming a coalition with other top teams and advocating through WSC for testing access. Seems it's a contentious issue.&#x20;

Your backup could be more in-depth simulation using Central Valley data and Australia data from the past and from sensors of the performance difference between Central Valley and Australia.&#x20;

How much did the Australia re-characterization actually change our race last year? I thought we still relied much on CEntral Valley data.&#x20;

Thanks for the input!

Yeah, I am worried that any testing in other parts of Australia would be less than perfect and efforts to make it happen probably long shots. However, post race analysis actually showed that Central Valley data was almost as different from Stuart Highway data as is track data; almost useless. And drivers say that driving in the US is no substitute for driving in Australia.

I guess the thing to do is just make sure WSC understands how important this is to us. I definitely plan to talk with Michigan, but as far as I know none of the Dutch teams did pre-race testing in Australia besides on the little strip of road WSC provides in NT. Do you know anything different?
