# Social Media Policies

This is the central page for all things social media, now the business team's responsibility. This page is a summary of social media practices and guidelines (some may be obvious, others not). Feel free to edit and add to this as necessary. See the subpages for more info about each specific social medium.

General Comments:

* The goal of having social media is threefold:1) Make more people aware of what we do and create a fanbase.2) Use that following as an incentive for sponsors to support us (exposure to a large audience).3) Share the joys (and hardships) of solar car racing!We want to post fairly regularly to keep our fans engaged and to onboard more followers.Michigan does a really good job with their social media (they've had a dedicated team for many years). Feel free to browse their accounts for inspiration (Facebook | Instagram | Twitter | Website).

* We should try to post at least 1-2 photos per week.Keep photos HIGH QUALITY. Nothing is more irksome than than a fuzzy/blurry photo.Feel free to filter/edit the photos somewhat in order to make them look good. Upping brightness, contrast and saturation a little bit usually does the trick, but you'll get the hang of it quickly. See some of our Australia insta photos for reference.When people comment on our photos, we should respond! If @commenting_user (for example) says something like "Awesome" or "Nice photo!", its great to respond with something like: "@commenting_user Thanks!!". Smiling emojis are great too. Feel free to be as exuberant about it as you want.We don't really follow anyone except core team members and other solar car teams or solar related accounts. I think we follow an account that posts photos of cute animals, but... that's okay :)HASHTAGSHashtags make our posts more visible, so we should use them (in moderation).6-12 hashtags per photo is good.Make them relevant to the photo, but if our car is in the photo you can also add ones that are generally automotive/clean energy.Here are some of the usual tags, feel free to pick and choose: #stanfordsolarcar #solarcar #solar #solarracing #stanford #engineering #racecar #cleantech #technology #carenthusiast #gostanford #solarpowerAnd some less frequent ones that might also be good: #car #auto #automotive #solarev #solararray #electricvehicle #motorsportsUse location specific tags too, and add a location when you post a photo for increased visibility.You can add 2 new lines (return key) at the end of your post and before the hashtags to provide some visual separation between the text and tags. See previous posts for example.If you need a good photo to post (throwback or otherwise), ask Hayden, Gawan, or Kelsey. They all have a stash of good, high quality photos from Australia and Arctan testing.If you want to post a text-based photo (eg. some sort of announcement or quote), try Recite (or any of the many other text-to-photo generators out there). I suggest Recite because it produces square photos and has decent backgrounds. You can also just use photoshop...
