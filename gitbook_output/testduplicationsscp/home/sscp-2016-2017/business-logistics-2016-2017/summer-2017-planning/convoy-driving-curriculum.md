General:

* The solar car should NEVER drive without a chase vehicle
* Follow all road rules; never speed; drive courteouslyThere are 2 exceptions:The chase vehicle and solar car should drive as one unit - they go through stop signs and traffic lights together (to avoid getting separated).The lead vehicle should never brake check the solar car - this means that you should go through a yellow/red light or pull off the road if necessary (obviously, if going through a red light, be as safe as possible, turn off to the side to avoid being in the middle of the intersection, etc.).

Make sure you are wearing the heatproof gloves.Pour all of the vermiculite sand into the battery compartment.If the fire is still alive, extinguish the remaining flames with the fire extinguisher.Recruit others as necessary to help you carry the sand or extinguisher.

* Make sure not to brake-check the solar car! You have a much better stopping distance than solar car does. This means:
* Pull off the road or go through a yellow/red light if necessaryThe team would much rather pay a ticket than have the solar car hit lead.Obviously, if going through a red light, be as safe as possible, turn off to the side to avoid being in the middle of the intersection, etc.

Make sure you are wearing the heatproof gloves.Pour all of the vermiculite sand into the battery compartment.If the fire is still alive, extinguish the remaining flames with the fire extinguisher.Recruit others as necessary to help you carry the sand or extinguisher.

Also check in if chase fails to warn you of road hazards, vehicles, turns, etc.If you cannot hail chase on the radio, turn your flashers on and pull over on the side of the road as soon as you deem it safe.If chase notices that the radio link is down, chase will give a series short beeps.

Solar car

* As a driver, you can say "no" but not "go". -- you can go slower than commanded but not faster; can choose to stay at a stop sign when given the all-clear to proceed, but not decide it's safe to proceed without being told to. (You can choose not to follow a command from the chase vehicle, if you deem it unsafe, but note that the chase vehicle has much better visibility than the solar car does, and may be able to see things you cannot).Be aware of large oncoming or passing vehicles -- they will suck you toward them and push you away.Losing radio contact with the chase vehicle:This may happen - if you don't hear from chase via radio for a while, check in. Also check in if chase fails to warn you of road hazards, vehicles, turns, etc.If you cannot hail chase on the radio, turn your flashers on and pull over on the side of the road as soon as you deem it safe.If chase notices that the radio link is down, chase will give a series short beeps.

Radio etiquette:

* Do not talk in the background if the radio in your vehicle is in use.Begin transmission with your vehicle, then "to" then the target vehicle, then message.eg. "Lead to chase, semi approaching".Can also use convoy to refer to everyone (eg. "scout to convoy, radio check" to determine if scout is in radio range).Use as few words as possible to convey meaning and avoid constructions that could mean something else if words are dropped.eg. Instead of "don't go" use "hold"Leave radio open for communication as much as possible.Break up longer transmissions into shorter segments unless interjections become necessary.eg. If conveying the next shifts positions from race crew lead, leave the line open enough that lead vehicle could interrupt with a warning.Enunciate, speak calmly, and keep your voice level as much as possible.Confirm that you have received a message."Lead to chase, semi approaching""Chase copies"(after a delay to let semi get closer) "Chase to solar car, semi approaching"Solar car should NOT copy messages for upcoming road hazards, but SHOULD copy every other message (eg. speed change, directions, etc.) when it is safe to do so.Radio check whenever beginning a shift:"Chase to convoy, radio check""Solar car copy""Lead copy""Scout copy""Trailer copy""Chase copy all"Proceed in this order!If a vehicle does does not copy, establish communication before beginning to drive (unless trailer or scout are out of range)Vocabulary & Phrasing:Objects:"semi"  --  large truck"farm equipment"  --  tractors or other large farm vehicles"car with trailer"  --  passenger vehicle towing something"pothole"  --  any divot, hole, or single bump (chase should indicate where it is, see below)"rough road"  --  bumpy, poorly paved road, a series of small potholes, dirt, etc."stop sign""traffic light"  --  usage:  "Chase to solar car, traffic light ahead.
