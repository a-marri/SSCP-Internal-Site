Crow’s Landing Test Drive

August 2, 2017

We will be test driving at Crow’s Landing this Wednesday 8/2.  We will leave the shop at 8am and return before 9pm.

The purpose of this test drive is to make sure that the car can operate safely at high speeds before driving on public roads in the Central Valley this weekend.  In particular, we want to make sure our just-assembled suspension can take full loads and meet WSC-mandated specifications.  Below is a test schedule put together by Rachel to test these conditions:

Leave VAIL at 1pm.

1. Drive in circles at varying speeds to make sure that nothing hits in wheel wells, also assess handling subjectively.

2. Drive straight at increasing speeds to know that brakes are working

3. Hard braking tests at varying speeds and adjust brake bias as needed.

4. Test behavior if car swerves at high-ish speed - dynamic response and steering response.

5. Once we know the car is working from above tests, do WSC mandated figure 8 test and slalom.

Leave Crows landing before 7pm.

Crow’s Landing is located here.

The main objective of this trip is to test our suspension.  We still have a lot of work to do on the car, and we only want to bring those absolutely necessary on this test drive.  There will be little to do on this test drive; it will mostly entail sitting on the runway and occasionally fixing things if they break.  We do not need any of our drivers to come on this drive, Rachel will perform these suspension validation tests.
