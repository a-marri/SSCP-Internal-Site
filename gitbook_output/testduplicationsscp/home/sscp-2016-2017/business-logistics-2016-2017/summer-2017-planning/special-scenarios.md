## Special Scenarios

Technical:

* Tire blowout -- how do we know?Regen does something funky while you're drivingIn 2013 this indicated something was wrong with a motorAccelerator pedal stops workingPower cycle? Pull over?Mechanical brakes stop workingCoast? Regen?Brake pedal miscalibratedHow do we know?Accelerator pedal miscalibratedHow do we know?Tire alignment is badCruise control fails--keeps kicking out of cruise, sets speed too low or too high, or turns on when you don't expect itPower cycle? Stop using CC?Steering is sticky or sloppyDriver display stops working (driver doesn't know speed)Reverse button pressed while driving (should do nothing)Reverse somehow engages while driving (could this happen? What would it be like?)
