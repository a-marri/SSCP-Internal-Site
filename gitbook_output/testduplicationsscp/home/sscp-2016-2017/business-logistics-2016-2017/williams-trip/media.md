WILLIAMS LANGUAGE

A team from Stanford University who are preparing to compete in the World Solar Challenge (a 3000 km marathon race across the Australian outback) have been working with the team at WilliamsAdvanced Engineering to develop a competitive new solar car for the 2017 race. The students visited the Williams headquarters in Grove for a 2 day workshop in which they covered the areas of aerodynamics, composites, vehicle dynamics, programme management and vehicle integration and instrumentation. Whilst there, they have also had a tour of the Formula 1 facility and Frank Williams’ private car collection which is housed in the company’s on-site museum.
