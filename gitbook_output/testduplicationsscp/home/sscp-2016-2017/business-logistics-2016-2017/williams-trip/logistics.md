LODGING

The Bear Hotel in Wantage, UK is about 7 minutes from Grove and Williams. We had four rooms, three of which were for solar car members (a single and two that each slept three). Breakfast and wifi were included. Note it is rather difficult to get an itemized receipt from their reception.

TRANSPORTATION

Rachel and Hayden and the DDL folks rented cards (two total) which were were sufficient for transportation to/from the hotel. People made their own way to Wantage from LHR. Fastest route was an uber/taxi ($90 one way and about 70 minutes); cheapest was a bus ($30 one way and about 3 hours including waiting for bus changes).

Flights were booked independently but reimbursed up to $1100. This ended up working for people who booked early; other people could not find flights under this amount.
