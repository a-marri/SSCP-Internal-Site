Aero (ian.turner@williamsf1.com)

* Run CFD using a transition model to predict where laminar flow becomes turbulent.  This will provide an additional feedback that can be used to improve design.Williams has an automated aero pipeline built in StarCCM.  A CAD is fed into StarCCM and results and plots are output when complete.  No need to manually mesh or postprocess by hand.  ANSA is used to preprocess particularly tricky CAD.Motivation: Solar Car bodies are extremely simple compared with F1 cars, with enormous tires and large cavities and such.For F1 cars, a rolling road wind tunnel is crucial, since cars are low and ground affects boundary layer.

Composites (iain.bomphray@williamsf1.com)

* Use a Tongue and Groove joint or Lap Joint to seal seams of door/topshell.  If this can’t be designed into mold due to concavity constraints, this can be made by adding material (potentially heat-resistant tape) to edge of mold to create overlap seam.Fibersim is a powerful software with a learning curve that can plan out layups.  Photoshop can also be used.Clean metals with Hydrogen Peroxide before placing in layup.Use Innegra polypropylene to elminiate shattering in accident.Use premade angled carbon fiber strips for adding strength to sharp joints like the chassis.  These can be purchased cheaply.See attached excel spreadsheet used for material strength analysis, could be used to meet Sundae’s drop requirements.Braking: Williams uses carbon fiber brakes.Williams uses a wide variety of prepregs with a range of cure temps.  2-stage cure can yield better quality.  X-ray and CT scans can give feedback on integrity of part.Williams recommends 1.25 - 1.5 FEA safety factor.

Testing and Strategy

* Testing: Williams always makes an extremely detailed test plan whenever the car is taken out on the track.  This makes sure that actions align with test objectives and time is not wasted.F1 racing strategy must also conserve energy, much is driven shape of track.  No specific parallels with solar car racing.  Primary advice: keep simulations as simple as possible as simple models are robust.

Suspension

* ADAMS is used for kinematics simulation.  Simpack also used.
* Tushar from DDL says he'd love to help us with suspension design.Springs: wheel rate and motion ratio determine the spring rateWheel Rate = Spring Rate * (Motion Ratio ^ 2)A motion ratio similar to a typical car is good (0.7 for normal car, 2 for sports car)We must determine desired wheel rateDampers should be used to limit travelF1 car front suspension10-20mm bump travelStiff springs for aeroInertersHigh caster and KPI for stabilityF1 car rear suspension70-100mm bump travel20-30deg camber gainInter-linked controls for pitch, don’t want to compromise with heave and roll

* Wheel Rate = Spring Rate * (Motion Ratio ^ 2)
* A motion ratio similar to a typical car is good (0.7 for normal car, 2 for sports car)
