## Meetings with Sponsors

2/29/2016 Fundraising Advice from Clancey

1. Meet with people in charge of financial decisions. &#x20;
2. Try very hard to set up an in-person meeting.  Ask for 10 minutes -- if they like you, the meeting might last an hour.  Top-people at companies are never as busy as they say they are. &#x20;
3. If a company is being wishy-washy, move on, you are wasting your time.
4. Develop a sense of the maximum amount of money that a company will to give, and ask for it.  Don't play around with "minimums".

(Email from Jim Liu)

Roman and I went to Ford Research Lab, Mercedes RDNA, Toyota InfoTechnology, and BMW Technology Office today. We actually got very positive feedback from reaching out in person and we plan on doing this in the future as well with other companies. Here’s a summary of what went down – Roman feel free to add anything if you think I missed something.

Ford – Ford actually just (within the past week) started talking to Stanford about a partnership for a program (not sure what). We also didn’t get past the front desk lady but she said that she would pass along our brochure and information to the appropriate people in the Office. Roman also got her to admit that she is most likely to not delete emails that included the words Stanford and Collaboration in the subject line. \*good tip for reaching out to big companies over email in the future. Not sure what the outcome will be.

Mercedes Benz – We got to talk with the Manager of Business Development in Energy Storage and he said he is super supportive of our project but doesn’t know how much pull he would have (he’s only been there for a month). He also asked a lot about what our timeline is like and wasn’t sure they would be able to provide much engineering help. He will see what he can do and from our interpretation, they might be our best bet at just getting cash and convoy vehicles although it would be a slower response because he needs to contact another division. It would also help if we let him know exactly what we potentially are looking for so that he could shop that around.

Toyota – Spoke with some woman who would pass along our information to a variety of divisions (b/c the InfoTech Office probably has the least amount of leeway to support us). We left our contact information and will wait to see what happens.

BMW – By far the most interesting (we had like a 15-20 minute conversation with a Senior Advanced Technology Engineer). He really liked the fact that we are a student group, but really wants to see what value supporting us would have. They have dabbled with solar power in cars but b/c it’s so far from a real-life application doesn’t have extreme interest in that aspect of what we do. He does see a lot of potential for SSCP to be like a research platform and this is where it gets tricky. He sees value if there are certain things we could test/try implementing (I.e. If BMW has a prototype composite material per se) and relaying those results back to BMW. Obviously this could be a double-edged sword. It could give us access to a lot of cutting edge materials and or technology, but we wouldn’t know how applicable it would be and if we could actually implement it. That said, testing if we can implement something would probably also be valuable for BMW even if we don’t implement it. But that requires a lot of trial and error and work (Perhaps a viable summer research project?). They have developments in almost everything that is relevant to us: Motors, batteries, composites, suspension, and driver/user interface systems (they do a lot of coding and sip development). He will contact his counterparts in Germany and will get back to us in a few weeks, but really wants a scope of what the research platform can be. We need to provide him with what we are willing to open up to testing…obviously the more open we are the better. I’m not sure how involved this ‘real collaboration’ would be but it is something to think about and might really help us or not.
