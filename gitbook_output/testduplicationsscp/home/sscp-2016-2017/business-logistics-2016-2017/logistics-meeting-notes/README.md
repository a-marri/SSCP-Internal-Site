# Logistics Meeting Notes

## Leadership Meeting

[](#h.bif6n3iog7y1)

January 31, 2016

### Races

[](#h.tos32j24ykif)

American Solar Challenge

    Requirements are too strict for Arctan.

        Need crush zone to right of driver, better brakes, bigger roll cage.

    We could fix up Luminos and race, but don't currently have the manpower.

Sasol, South Africa

    Not enough members interested.

    Not enough members available for training this summer.

    Would need to take the first week of school off.

Alex will email Morocco Solar Challenge.

    This race is relatively new and disorganized.  Not clear whether it will happen.

### Test Drives

[](#h.r9ihykjyh2zx)

We will do several test drives spring quarter.

These will give members race experience and build team unity.

Can replace some of the race.

### Summer

[](#h.wqqs4qggse62)

Sub-team leads ask members who would be interested, think of projects.

### Tesla Sponsorship

[](#h.pmfd0yqmj59)

Tesla is not likely going to give us money.

JB will introduce us to companies that could help us.

    Spreadsheet for sub-team leads to fill out components of the car that could use professional advice.

Other Sponsors

    Reid will get Jason Law contact information.

    Rachel will ask boss about Honda.

    Nissan is sponsoring other projects at VAIL.

## Major Parts Timeline Discussion with Arctan Leadership

[](#h.j0thf869x3y9)

January 23, 2016

We will use this discussion to decide deadlines for our Gantt Calendar.    

[ Gantt Calendar](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1SGS9aJ40BmXGGgFgllJ6KWbS-TH7at_7880HVqP3aqs/edit#gid=270073734)

### Aero Body

[](#h.xb6n4g6z4f42)

Ship aero body December 1

Get 2 mold manufacturers lined up

    Last time mold manufacturer was late

Finalize pipeline this week (Solidworks vs NX, Pointwise/SU2) vs StarCCM

    Discuss alternatives to Sabalcore (own dedicated CFD machine)

Be running iterations through our pipline by week 6

### Chassis

[](#h.y9b8ovk026z)

Decide if we can do carbon fiber tub chassis by June -- Hayden

        (Arctan's chassis is water-jet cut aluminum honeycomb material)

Need to knowledge gather -- we haven’t done this before and need to figure out

If we do a carbon-fiber tub chassis, we need to get molds fast

the chassis design will finish after the aerobody, but the chassis itself needs to finish before

Try hard to get an autoclave (ACP composites, SpaceX, Lockheed)

### Suspension

[](#h.ctoq7xplpkgw)

In Arctan, upright files were shipped to machinist on April 8

Have rear wheels not double A-arm?

Work closely with Aero team throughout summer

### Rollcage

[](#h.j0wqf3p4wlsz)

### Possible carbon fiber rollcage like Michigan.

[](#h.5guldrm7sg56)

Learn Ansys. See if we can sufficiently simulate safety factors by June -- Reed

Talk to Alumni, Michael, Companies like ACP, Williams to learn about carbon fiber analysis

Dependent on how rest of the car is designed

Integrating with layup is elegant, potentially battery design

Although it will save weight, weight doesn’t matter much

Think about how to mount seatbelt

## Layups

[](#h.21jfj14mj1yf)

### Spring Break -- Aero needs the iteration time

[](#h.66thnvij1hv0)

Communicate layup schedule early so members can plan

Get molds earlier so they can be prepped

    get 2 mold manufacturers lined up as protection against delays

Pre-cut carbon fiber, autoclave -- get an equipment sponsor

        Lockheed

        SpaceX

        ACP composites

Do an inventory of current products, set deadline to reach out to materials sponsors

        Hope to get free stuff from Boeing again

        Go to Tencota directly

        SpaceX

If Jamie redid Arctan Layups over Spring Break, he would build pieces in this order

        access panels

        bottom shell

        door

        then topshell during a weekend of Spring Quarter

### Steering Linkage

[](#h.vmzeqmlbmfp2)

Steering rack is a robust solution (known design, gives driver feedback), but --

    Some other of teams had carbon fiber linkage systems (Megalux, Tokai)

Add a steering damper or reduction gearbox (Arctan steering input too strong)

## Battery Pack

[](#h.p5fggkoz050o)

## get cells EARLY

[](#h.n705xdd4wxo)

Gawan should do some math on new technologies

     If there are better cells on the horizon, see if they are worth it

Move deadline EARLIER than Arctan’s cycle

Chineseum cells leftover from Arctan can make the first test pack

### Electrical Rebuild

[](#h.9x2r7o5zadyf)

“system on the bench deadline", March 1

    This will allow code team to finalize code early

Need to factor in characterization of cells -- we need the cells, and it will take around a month

### Machining

[](#h.dni3iwa01o0i)

Outsource redundant parts -- hardpoints, etc.

Outsource complex parts.

Otherwise, the person who designed a part should machine it

    Saves time, prevents mistakes

    Easy to learn

### Motor

[](#h.dwhui0sghbyv)

Research motors -- should we buy them this cycle?

        Some options: Mitsuba, Marand

        Lighter, would allow for different suspension design

        Could potentially support a battery pack with more cells

                We don’t use maximum # cells in our pack b/c of motor voltage requirements

We could redo just the mechanical design of current motors

        but currently don't have manpower for full redesign (esp. magnets)

X-ray current motors for cracks

        also our wheels

        routine maintenance
