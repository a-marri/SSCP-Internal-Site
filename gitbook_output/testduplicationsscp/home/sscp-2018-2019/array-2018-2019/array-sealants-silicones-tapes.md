Sealant: Dupont dow corning pv-804

Silicone: 3M 730 Clear

found a roll of 3m 8006 Solar Tape which is amazing, doesn't leave any residue. Doesn't really seem low tack but awesome for masking. Assuming they used this last cycle, but can't find an online way to purchase it??

190622 -- ran a test run with the sealant

* &#x20;I think the sealant is fine. Temp was way too hot (\~1:30) and was tacking within 5 min. Definitely the 4 way intersection joints got weird.<>Using a large popsicle stick was better than little. Going slow in one pass.realistically should be thinner stack, vhb under entire module edges
