* Rock Snider (rocks@bayviewcomposites.com) was the main contact - this guy is a hardo businessman so beware and don't throw money away before you have to (he will pretend his shop is busy to drive up prices)Molds seemed okay but not great surface quality and the weld job on the frame was pretty shoddy

* 'Molded Fiberglass Companies' (RMorrison@moldedfiberglass.com) - this contact is a Stanford alum c/o '66 and they've worked with some team in the past, like early 2000s. Contacted during Mamba cycle mold panic but they couldn't work on our short lead timethis is also the same as MFG West, mfgwest.com, see this page for more contacts https://sites.google.com/a/stanfordsolarcar.com/sscp/home/sscp-2012-2013/composites/molds/mfg-westChristensen Fiberglass Tooling (christensenrtm@sbcglobal.net, http://christensenfiberglasstooling.com/) - reached out to these guys for mamba but no response. Think they worked with Arctan maybe? here is a spreadsheet from the Xenith/Luminos era, which also references old pages on the internal site and closes the redundancy loop: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QGJtZ3OMz5pZKtUenV-s874XCv_GNKHDtn_MdSiLk1c/edit?usp=sharingthese contacts haven't been checked in ages, for the most part, but should give a good start

Autoclave

* Justin Sparr (CEO, ACP Composites, jsparr@acpcomposites.com) - We buy a good amount of raw materials from here; they have an autoclave that was almost big enough for mamba molds and were willing to work with us to try to figure out a fit & schedule but unfortunately the mold footprint was just too big. Gil Gallegos (gallegos2@llnl.gov) at lawrence livermore national lab has access to several ovens. The largest one has work envelope 4m x 2m x 2m.In theory, Kittyhawk Aerospace has an autoclave, but we weren't able to get in contact with them about it. if they survive the covid recession and anyone interns there you should make friendsSundae used SSL but they couldn't help us in 2019 b/c of money struggles so that might be dead still

Bill (William) Kreysler - ceo of a napa-based company called Kreysler & associates. Hasn't worked with any recent teams but did some foam machining and advising for some early teams and is apparently a goldmine of composites knowledge. Also his company built the death star for the star wars movies so that's dope. he's on linkedin

Ingmar (ingmar.jungnickel@specialized.com) was our contact at Specialized Bicycles when we stuck Sundae in their wind tunnel. I also talked to one of their tire engineers after stalking them on linkedin, they're usually fairly responsive & helpful

Jamie Goldfield and Phil Giliver are the go-to alumni for composites things. Also Adem Rudin.  jaygoldfield@gmail.com, phgiliver@gmail.com, adem.rudin@gmail.com. Jamie and Phil will generally respond to solarcore but I think adem has to be added separately since he's from Minnesota

Paly high school has a CNC router that they'd be tentatively willing to share access of (as of 2019) except that they can't figure out how to get it working with standard software or something? Like you'd have to do tech troubleshooting. But potentially useful since stanford does not have one as large

Reddit has composites forums that are mostly useless but if you post you can usually get ahold of and make friends with some of the folks who do human-powered-vehicle racing (like bikes with an ultralight composites pod shell around them) - they have good hands on experience/advice around super thin laminate aerobodies
