# Assorted Notes (Sarah)

From HPV bikes team guy (relevant to light, non structural aerobodies):

“Be careful with long segments of contiguous, flat, non-reinforced carbon fiber. It will increase the "wubba wubba" factor. This is a technical term my team came up with to describe how much a sheet will oscillate at a given relative wind speed. Units had something to do with amplitude per speed. Or maybe the energy of the oscillation (power transmitted by a string equation) per speed.

We understood that a high wubba wubba factor would reduce efficiency and cause undesirable sounds, but we also determined that we never even went fast enough for even our drag coefficient to make a huge difference in performance. That was namely because it was already pretty low, though. The bikes never went much more than 40mph.

To reduce the wubba wubba factor, you can just run some really narrow strips of honeycomb, or just really anything that isn't going to flop around, maybe make a grid? I'm guessing you could get away with having them be parallel, but I'm not sure which direction would be best.

Don't get too caught up in over engineering or producing and running a thousand simulations on cool models. It is important to validate your concepts, but the more time you spend on them, the less time you spend on actually making the thing. Balance is key.

Also, make sure you use thin epoxy. Thick epoxy will result in bendy layups. We made some thank you letters like that. Less poke-y, but more difficult to show off.”
