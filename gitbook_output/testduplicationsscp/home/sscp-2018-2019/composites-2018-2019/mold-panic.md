How Mold Panic Came to Be

This cycle we stuck to the Arctan/Sundae schedule of running aero through year 1 of the cycle and planning for a spring break Composites Week. (for younger team members' reference, Luminos completed their aero during the summer and shipped their molds to arrive during Xmas break to start their build earlier). 

We started conversations with Bayview Composites in mid-fall, mostly discussing the merits of direct vs. cast tooling. Direct tooling involves machining a mold directly out of foam and coating it in resin, while cast tooling involves machining a 'plug' in the shape of the car and then casting a composite mold around it. At first we wanted to try direct tooling (thinking we could get a sponsor to donate foam and cut costs) and then we learned that direct molds are prone to problems (not airtight for vac. bagging, prone to warping under heat or pressure) so we decided to return to a cast style mold. 

In early December we sent a nearly-complete CAD model to our contact at Bayview and he said he'd get back to us with any necessary changes over or right after the winter break. 

We heard nothing so we sent a checkin email week 1 of winter quarter. Bayview (Rock Snider) got back to us and said that they now had lots of work and a full shop, so they sent us a 70k+ quote for a mold that would be finished March 22 (Friday before composites week) with an optional 4k rush fee to get it done the 19th. 

We sent out feeler emails to alternative suppliers at MFG West, Christensen Fiberglass & Tooling, Scaled Composites and left a phone message at Ascent Aerospace after getting his quote on a Friday.

On Monday we got a "no" from MFG West and we checked in to see if the timeline from Rock/Bayview was still valid. They responded yes, saying that they could send an invoice for down payment, and that we'd get the promised ship date of 3/19/19.
