# SSCP - SVN access

# SVN access

Introduction

Subversion (SVN) offers both centralized storage and revision control for multiple users. It's an effective way to pursue engineering projects with multiple contributors.

It allows us to see who made changes and when. For plaintext files it can also summarize the differences between versions of files as well as merge conflicted versions.

In the past, we have used SVN for software, electronics, and mechanicals. In the future, it looks like software may be handled by git.

Gaining access

You'll be able to log in via Stanford's SUnet system using the same username and password as the one you use for Axess. Before you do that though, you'll need to ask any server administrator to add you to the list of approved SVN users. Right now that's Maggie Ford and Ella Hofmann-Coyle (email addresses).

On Windows, the easiest way to browse is to use TortoiseSVN. Install the program and add a repository by URL (Open Hard Drive. Right click>SVNcheckout. Copy URL).

On Linux systems you should consult the documentation for your distribution to install the official 'subversion' package.

Then, check out the SVN Protocol/Etiquette so that our repository can stay clean and easy to use.
