EE's use a lot of jargon. Whenever you're not sure what something means, look here! We'll try to provide the resources for you to understand what this is!

Bypass Capacitor

Decoupling Capacitor

Operational Amplifier (Op-Amp) - Essentially a magical black box that takes in two inputs, +/-, and has an output such that the output is amplified by a ton.

What's it used for?

Turns out, if you wire an op amp's +,-, and output pins in a certain way, you can be sure to get a really accurate gain. Here's a good intro, here's a more advanced intro, and

Diode

A cute little active circuit element that allows current to go one way and one way only.

Which way does it go? (Open backwardsDiode.png)

Follow the arrow!

Alternatively:

Cations are paw-sitive, and go to the Cathode. And positives attract, so they want to go to the negative end, which means the Cathode is negative.

VC

Vehicle Computer - Main control unit and connects several important components on the software side to the electrical side.

BMS

Battery Management System - Main electrical system. Connects the battery to the electrical components of the car.
