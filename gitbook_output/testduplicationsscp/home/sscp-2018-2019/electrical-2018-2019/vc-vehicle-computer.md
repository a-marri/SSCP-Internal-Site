# SSCP - VC (Vehicle Computer)

# VC (Vehicle Computer)

We will use the VC board from the previous cycle, and make adjustments based on rule changes and make improvements. We may break out transmitting components to another board so that they can be closer to the antenna, although this is currently TBD.

See the 2016-2017 cycle's VC page for more information. We will add more to this page as the cycle goes on.
