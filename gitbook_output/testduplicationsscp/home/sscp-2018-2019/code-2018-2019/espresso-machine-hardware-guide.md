On the right side of the machine, the buttons (in order from top -> bottom, left -> right) are Power, Rinse, Espresso, Double Espresso, Americano, Double Americano. The water tank is located on the right side of the machine and needs to be on correctly & filled with water for the machine to work, the machine will make a gurgling sound if the water tank is not on at a 90 degree angle. The grounds tray is located underneath the drip tray and can be emptied by removing the drip tray and then the grounds tray. Beans go in the top grinder compartment, spare beans can be found in the cabinet below the machine. Warnings to de-calcify the machine can be ignored.

The milk steamer currently does not work.
