Lessons:

* Always have someone who's never done the thing before try out your documentation before you consider it done.Getting new software up and running is incredibly labor and time intensive. For example, it took about two weeks and 31 emails with Sabalcore tech support to work out a reliable SOP for installing SU2 on SabalcoreAnd this is for a software that the team and the company are familiar with.Imagine with less support, or shittier software.One can do serious damage with an ill-placed rm command in Linux (All good now though)
