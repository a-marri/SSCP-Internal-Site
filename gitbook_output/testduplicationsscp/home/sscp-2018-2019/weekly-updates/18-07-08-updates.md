Mechanical + Composites

Key Points:

* Progress made on defining suspension/steering geometry Have identified bounding box for aero including max wheel travel from lock to loc&#x6B;_&#x49;MPENDING DECISION_: if we build a narrow car, are we going to make it boat shaped (from top view) to fit the steering (IE Tokai, Kogakuin) or just make it straight and narrow and try to do some cute push-out fairings (IE Michigan)cute push-out fairings will maybe be easier for Aero but harder for Mech/Composites. We <3 tradeoffsFor Mule Car, we can reuse much of Sundae's suspension but need to redesign the leading arms and the control arms in the front

* Lewis is developing a test plan for exploring the feasibility of magnet-clasped, vacuum-formed, beautiful plastic wheel shroudsFirst packaging scheme was ~~not awful~~ and looks hella stable from a weight distribution perspective: we were able to hit all our target numbersbut... we forgot to include the weight of the roll cage. It probably won't matter that much but will be included in further iterations.more final ideas of array positioning in aero may necessitate changes to the chassis length, which will cause more aerobody fit changes but shouldn't affect much else
