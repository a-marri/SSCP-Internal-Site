Lessons:

* Following up with people really helps with responsesMaybe a week before a big deadline, would be a good idea to write out all the things that need to happen to make the deadline, and plan them. We maybe fumbled a bit at the 1 yard line with scale model ship (just 1 day late out of 2 weeks though).Could have thought of and run the scale/tunnel sim a bit earlier
