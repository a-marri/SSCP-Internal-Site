Sponsors

Sarah: reached out to 4 alternative mold companies; talked w/ our current choice (Bayview/Rock) about quote and timeline. Reached out to Qantas re: car shipping over break. Reached out to Michelin re: tires. Reached out to Navy re: weather/shipping/convoy cars.

Cori: meeting with Alta

Aero

Key Points:

* we have a car! huzzah huzzah!We're struggling with mold manufacturing logisticsthe one person we were speaking with wants to charge lots of money plus overtime to get us the part *barely* on timewe don't have a backup plan in place but in the past have gotten molds with a 2-month lead timetl;dr: we can gamble with barely-on-time guy, or gamble with ditching him and finding someone else.

Array

Key Points:

* With EE, working on a stringing pattern that has sufficiently low voltage (<60V) and high current (4-6A) to be compatible with our array controllers (Max Power Point Trackers)>60V subject to additional WSC regulationsHad a DR! There are some concerns from Alumni and in general about blocking diodes (not controlling current appropriately when in parallel = fire)

Mechanical + Composites

Key Points:

* General plan for the quarter: Finish all major designs by mid February in time for a full-car integrated design review. (lots of integration work with array/EE/battery/everyone). Send out some individual part design reviews late January beforehand, and start shipping some parts.Design review lots of system-related things in the latter half of FebruarySpend early March writing a detailed manufacturing schedule for the full car (again, lots of integration work)
