Aero

Key Points:

* Aero is acclimating to the new toolchainIT sucks!Maggie is making heroic efforts to get our licenses workingReports are that NX is much better than Solidworks for surfacing! (Fewer errors, NX tutorial took about half the time to complete as the Solidworks tutorial)Having some issues duplicating Yuji’s mesh in Star CCM

Wins:

* More than halfway through surfacing our first bulletMaggie is most likely close to succeeding in the Battle of the LicensesToolchain looks like it’s going to let us do significantly more with our timeHaving trouble finding a tunnel for scale model testing, but we’re meeting with faculty that seem excited and willing to help us (at least) find one (super important for center of pressure validation)Everybody is documenting as they go!Incredibles II was pretty good

Losses:

* Meshing and CFD. There’s a lot of pretty specialized knowledge required, hard to understand documentation. We’re going to keep plugging away at itStreamlining the process for getting new cars into CFD. It’s possible, but we haven’t figured it out yetPossibly, scale model building. If we have to go with models larger than 2 ft in length, we might be challenged in what we can 3D print

Key Points:

* Set up more meetings for weekend of 6/13In the process of an in-depth BMS overview. Once we have a solid understanding of the current design, we can begin to address possible improvements that members from last cycle have suggested.Planning on beginning implementation of those improvements after 6/14 meetingsCreated BMS Overview Doc (in the drive.) Once complete, it can be used as a teaching tool.
