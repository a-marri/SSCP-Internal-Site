Lessons:

* Sabalcore is constantly changing stuff on their servers - don't assume that once installed, your stuff will stay the sameOverall still highly prefer Sabalcore over AWS - support we got from AWS was superb, but in the end Sabalcore's cluster seems to perform way better for our needsNote: changes can also be good. Doubled memory available on one of our clusters.Our crosswind template needs some edits
