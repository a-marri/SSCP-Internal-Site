* if you have mechatronic friends or are a mechatronic friend, consider building us a vibration table! Low stakes project with ~frequency analysis~, very fun
* in actual news, we made the car longer. Sorry aero team.
* Suspension geometry review has been sent to GM engineer and will also be reviewed by Tushar and/or Gerdes in the near future.
* @ aero team - we will be making any last large changes to packaging this week. Please chat with us about:steered wheel fairings vs not in front of carFX of longer wheelbasecar body heightmajority position of available space for small components (in nose or in tail?)straightness of aerobody between front/back wheels
