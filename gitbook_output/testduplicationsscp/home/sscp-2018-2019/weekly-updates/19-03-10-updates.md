Code + Strategy

Key Points:

* Strategy: no real progress on code this week. Weather/telemetry need to sync with business on a budget.Got a Proof-of-Concept for debugging by printing to a file.This will be useful when debugging BMS. Previously, we were stuck looking at a single variable's value, and was fairly difficult to debug. By logging to a file, we'll be able to quickly gather tons of data and then analyze it + plot it. Yay! Plots!
