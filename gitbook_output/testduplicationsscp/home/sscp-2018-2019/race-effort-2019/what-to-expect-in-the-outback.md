# SSCP - What to Expect in the Outback

# What to Expect in the Outback

This is a catch-all page for general race crew tips, things to expect, and travel info, feel free to edit to add more. Inspired by someone dm'ing me "but where will we poop in the outback?" Hopefully if you have a question, it can be found here.

Visas

Link for the online Australian visa application is here, costs $26.08 in USD or whatever the conversion from $20 AUD is currently. You will obviously need to get a visa for every/any country you plan to visit post-race.

Food

The team pays for food the entire time we're testing/racing, but you may want to occasionally buy your own food. Last cycle we ate a lot of sandwiches, peanut butter, jelly, nutella, nuts, lunch meat, canned beans, canned tuna, pasta, spaghetti, granola bar type things, apples, oranges, trail mix, plain ol' bread, you get the picture. We use propane camp stoves to cook food and boil water when not at a place with an oven. Gas stations have food like meat pies, sausage rolls, canned goods, bread, things to put on bread, a wide variety of drinks, and sometimes pre-made sandwiches, but not much fruit/veg. Adelaide, Darwin, Coober Pedy, and Alice Springs have grocery stores.

Water

Again, team pays for water and carries water jugs, but you need at least one giant water bottle and should keep it on your person always. It costs like $5 to get a water bottle at a gas station in the Outback. Solar car drivers will need to wear Camel-backs while driving to stay hydrated.

Elemental Protection

The Sun

Even if you don't normally burn you'll need sunscreen. There's a hole in the ozone layer above Australia and the UV rays are stronger than in the US. The team will have probably have some sunscreen, but you will also need your own. You can buy it in Australia.

The Flies

The outback is full of these fun moisture-loving flies that will go after open wounds, your mouth, your nose, and your eyes. Last time we got hats with mosquito netting for everyone and will probably do the same this time.

Sleeping Arrangements

When we're in the cities, we'll typically be in trailers at trailer parks, but when we're in the outback we'll be camping in tents at trailer parks, at designated camping areas, and at truck stops. Trailer parks and camping areas tend to have running water, actual bathrooms, and coin-operated laundry machines. During the race, we will be camping in tents wherever the hell we happened to end up that day, which is usually a random patch of dirt on the side of the road. Some people opt to sleep on tarps outside, in cars, or in the beds of the pick up trucks instead of in the tents. You can bring your own tent if you're picky.

Money

Most places, even in the outback, take card but you should check with your bank ahead of time if they charge an international conversion fee. Bring at least two ways to pay for things. An Australian dollar is about 70 US cents. You'll probably want to have some cash on hand in case of emergencies, and I think getting some of it changed over in the US is cheaper than doing it in Australia. You need to make sure you have some 20 cent/dollar coins to operate the washing machines and showers in the Outback or you're gonna have a bad time. Sarah S. wrote up a helpful doc on expected personal expenses for budgeting purposes. Something to note is that we will have to have most team members purchasing things like gas, food, etc and then getting reimbursed while we're in the Outback because there is only one team credit card and the convoy is split up often enough during testing that people sometimes have to get reimbursed for team expenses.

Packing Info

General Info

You get to bring up to two bags, a school-sized backpack and a standard-sized airline carry-on. We won't have space in the trailer for anyone to bring more stuff than that, and you won't want to anyway. Most people bring a backpacking backpack and a school backpack, the backpacking backpack stays in the trailer and your school bag has the things you need on a day-to-day basis and travels with you from convoy vehicle to convoy vehicle. If you don't plan on actually backpacking post-race, you can definitely get away with a small suitcase.

Connectivity

Wifi

There's generally no internet in the Outback, surprise surprise, so check out licenses for software like IAR and Altium ahead of time. Some trailer parks (like the one we stay at in Coober Pedy) have decent enough internet to do things. When in towns like Adelaide and Darwin, Maccas (McDonalds) always has free WiFi and is a good place to go check email or get work done if you need to. There is no Starbucks in Australia but some coffee shops do also have Wifi, it's just much more of a crapshoot than Maccas.

Phone Service

If you have T-Mobile, their phone plan includes automatic international roaming at a slow data rate (but it is enough to browse the web/use Google Maps) and free texting. If you have any other American cell phone service provider, you're going to need to get a SIM card once you get to Australia. Tesltra had the best Outback coverage last time, but Optus is also an option. Neither of those two providers has service outside Australia. Even with a SIM car though, you'll only have coverage maybe half the time in the Outback, actual towns tend to have coverage but the space in between does not always. We have satellite phones that we take with us to make phone calls from extremely remote locations in an emergency.

Toiletries

Showering

Showers are at most of the campsites and trailer parks that we stop at, so at least 60% of the time you'll have the option to shower. Some showers are free, some showers are coin operated, the coin operated showers usually only take one type of coin (I think last time they tended to be $1 coins.) You put a coin in and press the shower button and then the water only runs for like a minute, so shampoo yourself first or bring multiple coins.

Laundry

Also available at most of the campsites, pretty much always coin operated. There's not really time overnight to dry your clothes (we tend to not stay at one campsite long) unless you bring all athletic material type stuff, so it's worth it to pay for drying.

Taking a Shit

Most of the time you'll have the option to go to a gas station bathroom or trailer park bathroom, but when you don't, you'll take the backpacking poop shovel, wander out away from the convoy looking for a bush big enough to squat behind, dig a hole into the very dry Outback crust and then piss/shit into it.

Menstrual Stuff

If you're blessed/cursed with ovaries, you're gonna have at least one period in the desert. I strongly recommend that you get a menstrual cup and try using it a few times before you go, that way you don't have to carry toilet paper and ziplocs to wrap your tampons in if you get stuck and have to swap in the middle of the desert. Menstrual cups don't need to be emptied as often.

Driving

We drive on the left side of the road, obviously, but it doesn't take that long to get used to and if you have a US driver's license you'll be good to go for the duration of time we're in Australia. We don't drive at night because of the kangaroos. There are aerial speed cameras like everywhere in Adelaide and if you go even 1kph over the speed limit you will get a speeding ticket.
