# SSCP - Packing List

# Packing List

A suggested list of things you should either bring to Australia or buy before entering the Outback. Everything you bring needs to fit into (1) carry-on and (1) checked baggage item, the recommended route is to get a backpacking backpack for your gear and bring your school-sized backpack as a daily bag to carry from convoy vehicle to convoy vehicle. You can wear whatever you want during the test drives but during the race we wear our race jerseys and a safety vest every day. For more information, check out What to Expect in the Outback.
