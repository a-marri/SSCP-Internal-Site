Lodging status/list of options in each place: (action items highlighted)

Longest driving day is 10 hrs from Uluru to Devil's Marbles; doing big driving days lets us do things like go to Uluru in the first place w/out compressing testing. 10 hours starting at 7 in the morning gets you 7-12, 1 hr lunch, 12-6 for arrival during the daytime and no night driving

Adelaide town house: booked 2 of Danka's houses from the 1st to the 7th (checking out day of the 8th)

&#x20;\- last race, house in Croyden: reached out to Danka (owner) about re-booking; she says she'll get back to us soon (Jan.    2019)

Adelaide trailer park:  booked, need to pay

&#x20;\- had that place on the beach last time - lots of room to drive car around during initial debug. (Big 4 caravan park west beach: sent booking enquiry June '19)

Glendambo: figure out if we need to reserve this?  removed glendambo in favor of gaining a coober pedy day

Coober Pedy: nothing yet

&#x20;\- need to book trailer park slots (sent inquiry June '19 resent July '19)

Kulgera: do we need a reservation? check in 27 check out 28

Uluru: 2 options, both non-powered: free camping at Curtin Springs (\~1hr down the road towards Alice Springs) or not-free camping at the Ayers Rock Campground place (a few hundo for the night). Will email the free place and see if they think they'll have roll-up space.&#x20;

Alice Springs or West Macdonnell National Park: nothing yet

Devil's Marbles: do we need a reservation?&#x20;

Katherine: will stay at Katherine Holiday Park, sent email June 2019 requesting price for unpowered sites for the group - quoted $22 per head, need to submit deposit

Darwin:&#x20;

&#x20;\- last race stayed at Hidden Valley Holiday Park

&#x20;\- have initial reservation for 20 at Hidden Valley Holiday Park (Nov. 2018). one cabin doesn't open til the 5th so we'll have to stuff, or something (book a tent site?)

Adelaide post-race: 1x 6-bed female dorm + 2x 8-bed dorm at Sunny's Backpacker, $110 AUD (?) per head for the full week

&#x20;\- last race stayed at YHA hostel

&#x20;\- June 2019 - sent messages to Tequila Sunrise Hostel, YHA, Backpack Oz, Sunny's Backpacker Hostel, Blue Galah, Hostel 109 Flashpacker, both of the "Adelaide Backpackers/Nomad" locations. Sending inquries this late got 3 responses with space and several others that had run out of room, fyi for future teams if you're trying to stay in the CBD - this is probably ok but don't wait much longer?
