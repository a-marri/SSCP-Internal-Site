# SSCP - FREE GEAR FOR THE SQUAD

# FREE GEAR FOR THE SQUAD

We want free gear for the squad! We are especially looking for lightweight jackets, tech polos, and/or tech longsleeves, but we will take anything else as well (usually). In terms of non-clothing, we are looking for a lot of camping gear. 

we have sent cold emails to
