# SSCP - Expected Personal Costs

# Expected Personal Costs

1st thing - the team will do its best to make racing affordable for any team member and will discuss financial aid options on a case-by-case basis. 

This page contains a run-down of expected costs (necessary and optional) for the 'average' race crew member. Caveat that this is based mostly on my (Sarah S.) experience racing with Sundae.

Rough Summary

The average race crew member will:

* earn 7k over the summer
* spend $500-$1000 on housing costs in a subsidized house over the summer
* spend some money on food over the summer
* be provided $300 towards their to-Australia flight
* be provided lodging and basic food in Australia between arrival and packdown (~1.5 months)
* be responsible for providing basic camping gear (sleeping pad & bag, team will provide tents)
* spend a small amount on snacks/treats/comfort food before & during the race (optional)
* be responsible for whatever post race activities they engage in
* Sarah's budget for all costs during time out-of-country, including flights, was around 4500 USD. This included about 7 weeks of post-race travel in 4 countries. Most of the money was spent on optional post race travel; I probably spent 300-400 during testing and the race on things that felt important, plus cost of necessary flights into and out of the country.
* Buying equipment beforehand - my 4500 experience did not include all of my camping gear, since I already owned a sleeping bag and pad, but I did spend a couple hundred outside of that sum on a new pack and some small camping items.

Solar Car Summer

Since many of the race crew work for solar car on stipend over the summer, this is a good starting point.  Race crew members will earn about $7000 on stipend over the summer. If they choose to live with the team, we will subsidize housing to cost between $500 and $1000 for the full summer for each race crew member. If a race crew member is working a local internship somewhere that is known to pay extremely well (like Google or Apple), we may ask you to pay more of your fraction of the cost of the house, but will still do our best to subsidize as budget allows. (this is usually not a concern.) 

Please keep in mind that in order to provide housing this cheap, we generally have to share rooms between people - singles are not really available.

During the summer we will subsidize some social events such as team dinners and we will do our best to keep the VAIL snack cabinet full, but we will not provide groceries. The team houses will have kitchens and each house will probably hold 8-10 people.

Flights

Each race crew member is provided around a $300 flight subsidy. This will not cover the whole of the flight cost to Australia but will help to offset it. Many race crew members choose to travel after the race and so buy their tickets to Oz one-way; I think these usually run $400-$600 depending on when you buy. (I bought mine late so I'm not the best authority on this.)

Before & During the Race

The team will pay for all housing/lodging and basic food costs between the official team arrival date (either Aug. 31 or Sept. 1, tbd) and the end of race packdown (Oct 23 or 24). 

To expand on this - you will for sure have a place to sleep. In cities, we'll pay for hostels or Airbnb's; in the Outback, we'll provide big tents. Similar to the summertime, race crew provided housing isn't heavy on privacy - we share a couple *big* tents between the team, and housing usually consists of a lot of shared rooms. You'll make really good friends!

Each race crew member is generally in charge of bringing their own sleeping pad and sleeping bag for camping in the outback. We also recommend you bring an eating utensil or two, and some sort of cup/bowl to eat out of. Many race crew members bring a big backpacking pack as their luggage, since it's easy to move around and we'll be moving a lot over the course of our stay in Australia. That's up to you - suitcases are fine too - just be sure whatever you bring is easy to haul around and ok to get dirty. 

For food, we'll provide the basics for the entire stay, and there will be nicer food during the race itself. In the months leading up to the race, food will really be basic though. We'll have cereal/oatmeal and tea/coffee at breakfast, sandwich supplies and some fruit/maybe chips at lunch, and meat or eggs + sauteed veggies + rice at dinner. Many race crew members supplement this with snacks or treats bought at truck stops. So, tl;dr: you can eat completely for free during the 'team sponsored' time in Australia, but it won't be super special food during our month of testing in the outback. 

As we get closer to the summer and the team is more finalized, we'll send out a more serious suggested packing list as well as a food allergy form. 

After the Race

After packdown ends, you're on your own! Unfortunately, the team cannot subsidize your post race travel or extended stay in Australia. Many folks (although not all) do choose to put some of their summer earnings towards travel, whether for a few days or the remainder of the quarter, and whether solo or with a couple solar car friends. 

If it's helpful for reference, I spent about $4500 on my entire race crew experience, including everything from the flight into Australia, to the snacks and dining out while the team was together, to my post race travel. My entire budget came out of my stipend from the summer. Generally speaking, I didn't budget closely or try to travel extremely cheaply; I just tried to be reasonably non-exorbitant. 

My post race travel consisted of a week in Australia after packdown, including a portion of one car rental; about a month in New Zealand (including multiple car rentals split between 4-5 people); one week in Norway, and one week in Ireland. I didn't spend money on expensive tourist activities like skydiving/gondolas/bungee jumping/kayaking, but I did go out a lot. I spent some money on clothes to augment my race-crew wardrobe of dusty red t-shirts. Most of my lodging was in hostels or camping with the occasional Airbnb. I traveled in a group of 4-5 during New Zealand and with 1-2 other people for Norway/Ireland, which helped cut costs on car rentals & food. Happy to answer more questions in person if anyone has any! 

Sundae's race crew had lots of different post-race experiences as well! Some folks went straight home; some traveled only for a week or two; some went to Thailand or other parts of SE Asia; some went to Japan/China. Maggie spent some time living and working in NZ after the race, which is also an option (the work visa is really easy to get) so ask her about that if you're curious.
