Sponsorship Effort

As of December 2018, GM/Holden has declined to renew convoy vehicle sponsorship. Updates should be posted here as they come.

We've reached out to both Enterprise and Avis for potential sponsorship opportunities, but chances are we will be paying out of pocket for this.

June 2019 Update

Danielle has compiled quotes for renting convoy vehicles, linked in this spreadsheet. Need to actually submit reservations. Sarah has reached out to Dan the DDL trailer man, via Larry, to get in touch with Dan's friend in Australia who should be able to get us a race trailer of the appropriate length. This is still floating.

July 2019 Update

Peter is in the process of submitting final bookings for rental convoy vehicles and the small trailer (organizing on small spreadsheet). After not hearing final details or confirmation from Dan/Larry, Sarah also reached out to several racetracks in Australia asking about rental trailers in their networks. Still following up on these leads/no trailer is found and locked down yet.
