RULES FOR  THE ENTIRE CONVOY

GENERALIZED RADIO RULES

\--The instant you get in the car, turn it on and turn on the radio.

\--Keep all messages concise and precise. No one else can talk when you're talking.

\--Use only affirmative messages. Word occasionally get dropped, and the difference between "go" and "don't go" is important.

\--Vertex radios on channel 1, CB radios on channel 16. Vertex radios are for team communication, CB radios are for outside communication, mostly to request passing or tell people behind you it's okay to pass.

\--CB radios are there to communicate with other solar car teams, and with truckers. Road trains will sometimes ask you if it's safe to pass. Other team's CB radio numbers will be displayed on their cars. If a team radios main convoy from behind ONLY chase radio will respond, lead may sometimes be consulted on traffic. If we're approaching a convoy from behind, generally lead radio will get their attention and ask about traffic.

\--Radio checks are performed every half hour by chase radio. If you can hear a radio check, you must respond. Chase will start every shift by saying "chase convoy radio check" and the response order is "solarcar copy", "lead copy", "scout copy", "rita copy", "monica copy". Chase will then respond either "chase copies all" or "chase copies (whichever cars they heard.)"

\--If you're in one of the further cars and can only hear some of the cars for whatever reason, you can say something like "scout copies monica only"

\--When you get on the radio, first say your car, then the car/cars you're addressing.

\--If you're confirming you recieved a message, say your radio name then copy, for example, "Lead copy". If you're responding to someone non-obivous, you can say their name, such as "Scout copies chase."

GENERALIZED DRIVING RULES

\--If you're driving, it's your responsibility to refuel the vehicle before your shift (in the morning, or at the control stop.)

\--The exception of course is solar car, but if you're solar car driver you need to make sure the car stays on at control stops.

\--Unless you're scout, you will generally be going the speed of the convoy, as announced by chase. Scout generally drives highway speed.

GENERALIZED CONTROL STOP RULES

\--Control stops have to be 30 minutes, but we don't want them to take any longer than that. Make sure that you're back in the car ready to go 5 minutes before the time chase radio announces, 10 minutes if you're lead/chase/solarcar.

\--When you're at a gas station, make sure your jerry cans are filled with gas (or diesel!) if you have the time, this is especially important for lead and chase.

\--We've never had to do this before, but if lead or chase was about to run out of fuel during a shift, we'd have to sub in a different car for the convoy or temporarily drive without a lead vehicle while everything got sorted out, and sometimes we stop at sides of the road with no gas for the night, so jerry cans are critical at control stops.

\--Listen to your chase radio! They'll announce next shifts before arriving and then announce arrival time and leave time as we enter the control stop.

\--If you're scout, make sure the car is in a good place where it won't get shaded, and don't shade the car yourself. If you're telemetry person in chase, chase radio, or solar car, make sure the car stays on during the control stop! More individual tips below.

RULES FOR INDIVIDUAL CARS

RADIO ROLES

In the common commands section, a "##" indicates a separate radio transmission.

SOLAR CAR

-You have to respond to chase radio checks and to speed updates, but are otherwise not obligated to speak.

-If you notice that you lose radio connection, turn on both your blinkers to signal to chase your radio doesn't work.

COMMON SOLAR CAR COMMANDS

\----Solarcar copies chase

\----Solarcar radio check

\----Copy, setting cruise speed to seventy-four, 7-4 kph

\----Whatever else you do or don't feel like saying

CHASE

\--You are the brain of the convoy, and the only radio who addresses solar car.

\--You need to do radio checks approximately every 30 minutes, see above.

\--You give directions to solar car based on what the telemetry/strategy people say, what lead radio says, and your own judgement.

\--When telling the solar car what speed to go, say the speed both in words and in numbers (i.e., Solar car decrease cruise to seventy-three, 7-3 kph)

\--Unless there's an emergency, chase radio stays in the car on the radio until the solar car driver is clear.

\--You can (and should!) ask lead for help when you need additional info on traffic.

\--Chase tends to repeat a lot of lead's commands so the solar car can hear them. Use your discretion to decide what needs to be repeated.

COMMON CHASE COMMANDS

\----Chase convoy, radio check

\----Chase solarcar, radio check

\----Chase copies solarcar

\----Chase solarcar, set cruise speed to seventy-four, 7-4 kph

\----Chase solarcar, prepare to turn (right/left)

\----Chase solarcar, hold

\----Chase solarcar, turn (right/left)

\----Chase solarcar, slow

\----Chase solarcar, stop

\----Chase solarcar, road train approaching

\----Chase solarcar, (roadkill/pothole) in lane. ## Bias (left/right/center) in lane.

\----Chase solarcar, car passing on the right

\----Chase lead, (increase/decrease) lead distance

\----Chase lead, please announce (please stop announcing) (some observation lead has been making)

\----Chase lead, advise on traffic

\----Chase scout, clear to pass the convoy

\----Chase convoy, the next drive shifts will be ## (break convoy into short messages 15 min out from the control stop)

\----Chase (monica/rita), increase follow distance

\----Chase solarcar, pull over (now/behind lead/at the junction)

\----Chase solarcar, you are right biased in your lane. ## Move to the left.

\----Chase solarcar, lane position is good.

\----Good job solarcar

LEAD

\--You are the eyes of the convoy. You do not address the solar car. Most of your commands will be "lead convoy" or "lead chase".

\--Call things that you see slightly ahead of when your car drives past them, unless chase tells you otherwise.

\--Normally solar car can hear you, but you can't hear solar car. (This may change this cycle since I changed the radios.) If you can't hear solar car during radio check, leave an appropriate pause before responding.

\--Animals should only be refered to by their name and not "roadkill" if they're alive.

\--"Road" means on the physical road. "Shoulder" means edge of road/other roads turning into the highway. "Lane" means the lane the solar car is in, "oncoming lane" or "other lane" means the right lane.

COMMON LEAD COMMANDS

\----Lead convoy, road train approaching (After you announce this, the entire convoy sans chase needs to be quiet until it passes.)

\----Lead convoy, (bridge/hill/cattle grid) ahead

\----Lead convoy, (roadkill/pothole) in (right/left/center) of lane. ## Advise bias (right/left/center).

\----Lead convoy, speed (reduces/increases) to eighty, 8-0 kph ahead.

\----Lead convoy, stale green light (fresh green light, yellow light, red light) ahead

\----Lead convoy, car entering road on (right/left)

\----Lead convoy, left lane ends ahead

\----Lead convoy, cow on left shoulder (cow in left of lane, cow in right side of road, etc).

\----Lead convoy, car on left shoulder

\----Lead convoy, slow (car/convoy) ahead. ## (Car/convoy) speed is fifty 5-0 kph.

\----Lead chase, traffic is clear (the opposite of this is "cars approaching", do not use "traffic is not clear")

\----Lead copies chase

\----Lead copies scout (only if chase does not copy, lead can act as an intermediary)

SCOUT

\--Scout radio typically does not speak much while driving. You need to respond to radio checks if you're in radio range, and be within radio range around control stop time and around 4:00-5:00pm so you can hear instructions from chase.

\--At control stops, scout radio (and scout passengers, holding handhelds) will speak to solar car to guide solar car in.

\--Part of your responsibility as radio (and therefore navigator) is pay attention to the convoy speed, and pick a truck stop, campsite, caravan park, or flat patch of gravel on the side of the road where the team will stay for the night. We can stop any time between 5:00pm and 5:10 so the solar car MUST arrive at the intended campsite in that window, do the math and figure out where a good place would be.

\--Things that scout radio can (and should) warn the convoy about are things like giant oversized trucks (not road trains, only truly huge cars), other solar car teams, car crashes or car-sized debris in the road, big detours off the highway, basically anything large that would take longer than 15 seconds to plan for. If chase is having an important conversation with solar car, wait until chase is finished to say anything.

COMMON SCOUT COMMANDS

\----Scout convoy, (twente/michigan/nuon/whoever) convoy ahead.

\----Scout convoy, oversized load approaching.

\----Scout chase, we found a (truckstop/campsite/etc) at (some useful measure of distance)

\----Scout chase, clear to pass?

\----16 (21/2/3/whoever) is it clear to pass?

TRAILERS

\--Trailer radios respond to chase radio checks when in range, and will occasionally recieve additional instructions.

COMMON TRAILER COMMANDS

\----(Monica/Rita) copy

\----(Monica/Rita) copies (Rita/Monica) only

\----(Monica/Rita) (Rita/Monica), chase told us to (whatever chase said)

DRIVING ROLES

SOLARCAR

\--Listen to chase! You're allowed to stop actions chase tells you about if you're uncomfortable, but you're not allowed to tell yourself to go. For instance, you can't turn into a highway until chase tells you too, but you could wait if you were uncomfortable. Generally though, just listen to chase.

\--When you first get into the car, make sure you do a radio check, and always remember to UNDO THE PARKING BRAKE before trying to drive.

\--If chase radio does a whole bunch of short beeps, that means they think your radio is down, try to radio them back then pull over.

CHASE

\--Chase driver has to follow the solar car very closely. You need enough space to brake if the solar car suddenly stops, but not much more space.

\--Keep your hazards and amber roof light on while driving.

\--If the solar car goes through a light/stop sign/intersection, you go through as a unit. If that means running a red light, you do it. Do not let yourself get separated from the solar car ever. The one notable exception would be if someone tries a dangerous passing maneuver into on-coming traffic and you need to pull back to prevent a crash.

\--As driver, you should be watching for cars/road trains passing you on the right, and warn chase radio so they can warn solar car.

\--You cannot leave the chase driver seat until the solar car driver is out of the solar car (unless chase radio tells you to). You need to be in your seat at least 5, preferably 10 minutes before the convoy goes anywhere.

\--Use your horn and hazards to prevent people from passing if they try to pass at a dangerous time.

\--Hug the solarcar closer when random cars pass so they know to pass you together

\--If you can't reach solar car via radio, repeatedly hit the horn with short honks until the solar car notices and pulls over.

\--Your job is ultimately to protect the solar car from accidents from behind, and from being t-boned. If something bad happens and you have the opportunity to crash your car to protect the solar car, you should crash your car. This is an extremely last resort though, and rare.

LEAD

\--Lead driver has to keep about five cars worth of space between them and the solar car. Chase radio will advise you on your lead distance.

\--Use cruise control to set your drive speed to the speed of the solar car.

\--If a light suddenly turns, you generally need to run the light so that solar car does not rear end you. Under no circumstances should you give the solar car a chance to rear end you.

\--If you get separated from the convoy, slow down without getting off the road and communicate with chase over the radio until you are back in position.

\--When the main convoy (lead, solarcar, chase) pull off on the side of the highway or a control stop, you need to pull off too, but make sure you're sufficiently in front of the solar car. The main exception to this would be if chase radio gives you a different command.

\--Like chase driver, chase radio, and lead radio, you are not allowed to leave your seat until the solar car driver does. The exception of course is if chase radio tells you to.

\--When pulling back onto the road, you need to go slow until your back wheels touch asphalt, then speed away to an appropriate distance. Do NOT fling gravel at the solar car by revving your wheels earlier.

\--When we pull off the road, you will generally still be two or three cars ahead of solar car. If we're making a turn, you will turn first, pull off onto the shoulder, and then wait until chase and solarcar turn to continue down the highway.

\--If we're in Darwin or Adelaide, you can't do as much of the pulling off of the road. Stay on the road and drive slow until chase/solarcar catch up. You do not ever want to be behind the solarcar, and that can happen if you pull off in traffic.

SCOUT

\--Scout drivers from other teams (coughs TWENTE) are famously assholish. If you're not busy, you're allowed to pull off to take pictures of our convoy or other people, but do not hang out in the oncoming lane taking pics of other people's cars, and don't split up anyone's convoy.

\--Since you move faster than all solar car convoys, you will pass a lot of them. Make sure your radio contacts the convoy and asks for permission to pass, and either pass the entire convoy very quickly all at once (prefered) or pass chase/solarcar then hang out closer to their lead vehicle until you can pass their lead car.

\--Keep yourself within radio range, but not within eyesight, unless you have an explicit job or need to peel off to get gas.

\--Arrive at control stops and the campsite ahead of the rest of the convoy

\--Scout's general distance will be 1km ahead of the convoy, but you will sometimes be instructed to check out weather/control stops ahead of time, or you may use your discretion to take pictures

TRAILERS

\--Trailer will generally drive the speed of the convoy and arrive at control stops with the convoy. Stay out of sight of the convoy, but try to stay within radio range if possible. According to the regulations you have to be at least 1km behind chase. Sometimes trailer will need to peel off to get gas, after getting gas trying to catch up with the convoy will be basically the only time you go actual highway speed.

\--You're gonna get passed a lot, get used to it

CONTROL STOPS

SOLARCAR

\--You will pull into the control stop following scout's commands, exit the car unassisted, make sure the car stays powered on, and grab your water bottle to run to the control stop button to start the control stop. We probably won't finish the race if the car doesn't charge at control stops, so DO NOT take the steering wheel with you, and DO NOT turn the power off. Set the parking brake. Make sure your radio gear stays in the car or makes it to the next driver. Additionally, the screen/backup camera has to be on when we pull into control stops and when we leave them- technically, the screen should be on 100% of the time, but people will only be able to see our solar car's internals at the control stop, so don't slip up.

CHASE

\--Your responsibility is making sure the car gets into the control stop safely and quickly without scraping, and then hand the car off to the scout car. Radio shouldn't leave until the driver is clear just in case something happens. Chase radio lets the convoy know what time we arrive and what time we pull out every time we reach a control stop.

LEAD

\--Once you pull into the control stop you're no longer needed unless Scout is not there. In the case that scout does not make it to the control stop, you will become temporary scout and chase will direct you. Otherwise, go get gas and get back into cars as fast as possible.

SCOUT

\--You need to arrive at control stops at least 5 minutes ahead of the solar car. All scout passengers will get out, figure out where the solar car will park, figure out the safest part of the road for solarcar to drive in on, and stay reachable on radio via the handhelds and the scout radio. Whoever is "radio clown" (normally a scout passenger) will walk next to/in front of solar car without shading the array and talk to solar car on the way in. Scout stays at the control stop until chase/lead/solarcar leave, and then will have to pass the convoy to get out in front again later.

TRAILERS

\--You need to be at control stops about 1km after the main convoy so that if any of your passengers are in lead/chase next shift they can make it.
