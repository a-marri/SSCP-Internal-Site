# Brakes Future Ideas

* Explore using a fully integrated set of brake hardware, such as the rotors, calipers, master cylinders, and brakeline from one dirt bikeLook at outsourcing T-Splitters from Galfer or another company or machining them less jankilyLook for better brake pads, such as fully metal pads or a different brand of calipers and pads then Shimano, as the Shimano H03C Metal resin brake pads were seriously eaten from brake rub and brake useRedesign the brake bias for easier adjustmentBetter location of master cylinders (potentially explore slots and washers/nuts)Design another paddle (essentially identical to the throttle paddle) for the regeneration brakes. This will allow the mechanical brake pedal assembly to massively shrink in size because it won't require the Hall Effect sensor or space for regeneration. The combination of a paddle regen brake and the pedal mechanical brake is the best design that we currently see moving forward but still explore all optionsIntegrate parking brake into design earlier, light weight options include straps, pins, and wedges
