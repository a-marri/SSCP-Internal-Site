# SSCP - Vehicle Design & Modeling

# Vehicle Design & Modeling

Our vehicle design is driven first by safety and then by competition rules, aerodynamics, and any other factors that we feel will help us develop the fastest vehicle we can. 

Here is a running document of full-vehicle design decisions and the justification, math, or thought processes behind them.

This cycle we worked to develop a vehicle simulation based on vehicle dynamics taught in ME227 and used this to verify portions of our design. The code base is hosted on SSCP's github in the repo solardrift. Ask Sarah for access if needed!

For a quick intro to git and gitflow, Codecademy's git tutorial is a good starter. If you're new and looking to play with the code, please branch off of master and don't merge your branch back without checking first.
