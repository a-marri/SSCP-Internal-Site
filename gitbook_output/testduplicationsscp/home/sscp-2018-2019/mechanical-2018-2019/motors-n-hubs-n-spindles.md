#### Front Hubs

See this spreadsheet for measurement/tolerance information (most hubs were questionably within tolerance): Front hub bore measurements

[Front hub bore measurements](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19RdL5SyHcmFtK1NcOXr3q0FtAGZVwDv4kMpavfpZG5M/edit#gid=1720871963)

we got some more hubs after the first were out of tolerance, but the new ones were also out of tolerance ¯\_(ツ)\_/¯

We put new spindles in two of the hubs. Also in two of the motors. The intention was to complete most of our race miles on new spindles b/c we were feeling mindful of wear on the old parts. But we weren't worried about it enough to completely not drive on old spindles, and by the time we were thinking about this we didn't have the cash or the time to machine additional new ones.

#### Embedded Content

The hubs leave extra space around the bearing spacer piece if each bearing is pressed fully "home". Consider editing the design of the internal cavity next cycle to move the small bearing towards the large bearing by an appropriate amount.

Assembly Instructions

When pressing bearings remember to support/press on the appropriate race (outer if pressing into a pocket, inner if pressing onto a shaft).

* Clean inside of the hubs with IPA on all bearing seat surfaces. Place a Smalley wave spring into the hub in the seat of the smallest bearing.Use IPA to clean the packaging oil off of the small bearing (size 6006) and apply yellow Loctite 641 retaining compound. Press the bearing into place. For these small bearings in the hubs with extra axial space, try to leave 1/8" or so of space on the wave spring. Put Mobil1 synthetic grease (red tube) on the inside of the bearing spacer and the inner race of the small bearing. Put the bearing spacer in place inside the hub. Clean and Loctite the large bearing (size 6027). Press fully into place until it seats against the inner shelf of the hub.Place a Smalley retaining clip into the groove above the large bearing. If the clip does not snap fully into the groove, your bearing is not in all the way.Center the bearing spacer and grease the inner race of the large bearing.Does your spindle have the bolts for the brake rotor in place? Use tape to keep these from falling out while seating the spindle.Press the spindle in from the wheel side down, supporting the inner race of the lower bearing with the short aluminum tube jig. The lower step around the outside edge of the spindle should be flush with the hub.Place the hub in a wheel and use the magic socket to torque the bearing nut on to 80 N-m. Remember that bearing nuts get seated bevel-side towards the bearing.Stick a piggy bank stopper into the small hole of the spindle.You're done!&#x20;

Disassembly

This is just like assembly but backwards. TAKE THE BEARING NUT OFF BEFORE YOU PRESS OUT THE SPINDLE. Take the circlip out before you press out the bearings.&#x20;

There is no good way to disassemble these hubs while maintaining perfect bearing health. Throw out used bearings (or accept that they'll be possibly a bit defective.) Don't lose the bearing spacers or the bolts for the brake rotors. Nuts for the brake rotors are one-time-use only.

#### Using Old Parts

Bearings

SKF bearings have a shelf life (in fresh packaging) of 3 years. We tried using some old bearings of unknown age and had noticeably shorter free-spin results on some of our hubs; we think it was the old bearings and threw out any additional old ones that we couldn't ID the age on.&#x20;

Spindles

When the spindles were designed Luminos-cycle, they had the lowest FOS on the entire car. The failure point is one of the neck-down portions of the internal half of the spindle. The team owns 13 spindles: 9 from the original batch and 4 that were machined but never used during Sundae cycle. Mamba cycle we are attempting to use the newly machined spindles as our primary set and other old ones as spares. See the motor log on the warp motor page for approximate mileage information on the old spindles (spindles aren't necessarily labeled/tracked as motors are but maybe should be).&#x20;

Titanium _in theory_ has "functionally infinite fatigue life" so long as you don't exceed a certain stress threshold during use. This is nice, and Arctan did a nice writeup (Motor Spindle Longevity Analysis) on their decision to use the spindles again- just for their cycle! Fatigue life and updated load cases are something that you should think about any time you're going to repeatedly use a legacy part across several widely varying designs (spindles, rims, talk to sarah about motors). The health and safety of the spindles is by no means guaranteed.

If you decide to machine more new spindles to avoid driving on 10-yr-old parts, know that you can successfully ship these to china, but you also have to ship the stock! Chinese machine shops are well known for cutting corners through using slightly off-nominal metal alloys (like mystery meat! but aluminum or whatever) so for a part like this where the material characteristics are very safety critical, the only way to be sure is to buy the titanium here from a trusted supplier and ship it overseas. Factor in shipping costs of $1k-$2k ish.
