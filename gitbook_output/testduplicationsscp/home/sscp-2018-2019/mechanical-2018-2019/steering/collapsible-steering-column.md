# SSCP - collapsible steering column

# collapsible steering column

The Black Mamba steering column is made to collapse when subject to a sufficiently strong impact on the steering wheel. An impact of this strength would occur only in the event of a crash, in which case the driver's chest would hit the steering wheel. In order to prevent it from causing serious injury to the driver, the steering column should collapse from an impact that would break the ribs of a human.

There are three parts involved in the collapse of the steering column. These three pieces are a shear pin, a carbon hex tube, and a machined collapse sleeve that is attached to a circular carbon tube. The shear pin is a nylon bolt that is bolted through the carbon hex tube and the collapse sleeve. The shear pin is loaded in double shear. When it breaks, the carbon hex tube will be pushed through the collapse sleeve and into the circular carbon tube. The calculations for what size the shear pin should be are attached to this page, as well as a screenshot of CAD depicting the carbon hex tube, shear pin, collapse sleeve, and circular carbon tube.
