The molds for the wheel covers were made by We Cut Foam out of styrofoam. This material choice was not ideal as it risked coming apart when the carbon was pulled off. Modulan or stacked plywood may work much better. However, when coated in enough epoxy and reinforced in some places with teflon tape, styrofoam was just sufficient. This epoxied surface was thoroughly and repeatedly covered in Loctite Frekote to aid releasability.

One layer of spread tow carbon fiber was sufficient to create a light and (mostly) airtight layer. Twill was inferior in this regard. Like the wheel shrouds, this layer should be laid flat and saturated with resin before being draped over the mold and vacuum bagged (with peel-ply and absorber). For the interior covers, it may be necessary to cut the center bump into wedges before laying it up, covering any gaps with excess strips of carbon. The vacuum bag can be taped to the table around the mold.
