CFRP

CFRP is differs from the other materials mentioned in that it is a category rather than a specific item. This material combines what was used in the last iteration of the wheel shrouds (carbon fiber) and the material we intend to use for the purpose of cost and fabrication methods (plastic).

Another direction for this project is to reach out to teams that have worked with wheel shrouds in the past and try to get some information from them. Sonnenwagen and Tokai, for example, have already implemented designs for wheel shrouds into their vehicles.&#x20;

I reached out to the Sonnenwagen team and had a productive discussion with them about the wheel shrouds. Despite our initial thoughts, Sonnenwagen had not thought through the wheel shrouds any more than we had, but their final product looked refined as a result of their use of plastic. Though the exact material was unclear, they mentioned that they were looking into CFRPs (carbon fiber reinforced polymers), which provide a superior strength-to-weight ratio as compared to other plastics. The only downside is that CFRPs are expensive. Here are some quick calculations that were done to determine how much weight could be preserved by using CFRPs:

Based on these results (with a potentially problematic assumption), CFRP seems like the obvious choice due to the massive weight savings that would come with it. This extreme difference in required weight would allow us to use more CFRP for a stronger shroud without adding too much weight as compared to the ABS equivalent. However, for the purpose of making a scale model, the use of the much cheaper ABS seems like the more reasonable solution. ABS has been said to be environmentally detrimental, so ideally a new solution can be agreed upon for the final shroud, but if that is not possible it will make for a good solution for our current design challenges.

After creating the CAD model of the shrouds in SolidWorks, I used the Mass Properties tool to find that half of the wheel shroud would weigh 2.92 pounds if made out of ABS. This would mean that the full shroud would be roughly 6 pounds and all of the shrouds combined would ultimately add about 24 pounds to the car (not counting fasteners or suspension mounting). The shrouds from last cycle came out to about 2 pounds per half when measured on a very questionable scale found in the Mech Bay. This addition of 2 pounds per wheel (8 pounds total) seems like a large enough sum to where slight redesign is worthwhile. Prototype put on hold not only for this but also for means of production.

As one last addition, here is a document that is a guide to plastics for prototyping and production. This resource may help with making the final decision for what material to use for the wheel shrouds if it is determined that ABS is too heavy.

I successfully communicated with two vacuum-forming companies (McNeal and Bell) and with most of the 3D printing companies. McNeal told me upfront that they were too busy to do a project of our scale, but Bell did give us a quote. The cost for the entire wheel shroud project through Bell would be roughly $8.5k (includes tooling, molds, and the shrouds themselves). This seemed steep to many members of the team, so we thought to create the molds in-house in order to save some money (roughly half of the cost came from the tooling and molds so it seems well-worth to do that ourselves if possible. Nonetheless, we do not have the tools to make the molds in VAIL so we will have to wait until the school year starts in order to get a prototype.

The brief stint with the idea of 3D printing the shrouds led me to email a plethora of companies (listed above) and all of those conversations ended in a similar fashion. My initial message to all of these people included the dimensions of the wheel shroud and the desired material, which in a leap of faith was listed as carbon fiber filament. All of the companies gave similar responses: the part was too large to print in one piece and they did not use carbon fiber filament. Some of them gave me recommendations for specialized places that maybe had the capability to 3D print something of that size, but what this said in my mind was that it would be extremely expensive and in the end these specialized organizations never even replied to my emails.

Vacuum forming is then our most viable option, but there is still time to look into other fabrication methods if we are to stick to an estimated $5k budget.

Fastening

The wheel shrouds are composed of two halves that combine to enclose the tire. The connections between these two halves must be strong enough to resist the forces on them, but they must also be simple enough that the two halves could be separated in little to no time. The reason for this specification comes about from the possibility of a flat tire, which case we would have to remove the wheel shroud to then replace the tire.

Carbon Fiber Shrouds

The most recent attempt at creating wheel shrouds was done with carbon fiber. The two halves have small tabs where fasteners are inserted. The fastening method employs the use of quarter-turn fasteners and stud ejectors. These fasteners are not the most elegant solution to our issue and it would likely be hard to use this same mechanism in something like plastic. Another necessary feature that was observed in the carbon fiber iteration of these wheel shrouds is the mechanism to attach the wheel shroud to the uprights of the car. These are just brackets that allow for fastening to the vehicle. This may be a difficult feature to copy over to a plastic iteration since adhesives do not work very well on that type of material. Lastly, the inner half of the wheel shroud was cut out so as to accommodate the motor/suspension parts. This looked like it was done by with a bandsaw or even by hand. Although this method would work fine on a material such as carbon fiber, the feasibility of doing this on plastic is up in the air (images of carbon fiber shroud on the next page).

There was a brief moment where we considered going back to carbon fiber wheel shrouds in the form of a 3D printed carbon fiber filament. The reason this idea came up was because of the complex nature of the geometry of the shrouds when the magnet fastening mechanism was still in place. 3D printing would allow us to achieve this geometry while also giving us the freedom to choose the material that would best suit our needs. Here are some screenshots of the CAD for the carbon fiber versions of the wheel shrouds:

We chose to not continue with this idea to the possibility of simplifying the shroud geometry and the fastening mechanism.

Plastic Shrouds

The new concept for this part of the vehicle involves vacuum forming plastic into the desired shapes. Based on the material findings above, it seems like ABS will be the best fit for our needs due to cost and desirable qualities for dealing with conditions under the car and in the Outback. Due to a lack of familiarity with the capabilities of vacuum forming, some of my design concepts may be unusable. Nonetheless, coming up with ideas at this stage regarding fastening and car-shroud integration is crucial to creating a successful design by the end of the cycle.

Here are the results of a design session regarding the attachment of the two halves of the wheel shroud:

After taking in all of these ideas and continuing to tweak the design, a final concept was agreed upon in the case that magnets effectively serve as fasteners (depicted below):

The next step is to run tests on the magnets in order to determine if they are a viable option for the purpose of holding the wheel shrouds in place with minimal vibration. This will be placed on hold until I receive permission from Cori to purchase magnets and have them delivered. For now, I have started thinking about how I will test the magnets and the result is depicted below:

The fastening method mentioned above brought with it some issues. The magnets complicated the geometry of the shroud itself since there had to be specific points where the magnets could be attached. Furthermore, since magnets are much weaker in shear, a pole-receptacle system had to be established, which again complicated the geometry of the shrouds. Another consideration with this mechanism was the fact that the magnets would not separate unless a moment were applied. This then forced the creation of a tool that would solely be used to remove these magnets. There was general agreement that this all seemed unnecessarily complicated since there were so many little pieces that required rigorous thought and work, but also it made for geometries that may or may not have been capable of being vacuum-formed. The latter reason is the most definitive since the whole point of this project revamp was to simplify the process from last cycle. Since vacuum-forming is the most simple and effective way of making a rigid wheel shroud, it is best to stick to this fabrication method and tweak those things that are making the main process more difficult. This resulted in changing the fastening method to incorporate latches that hold the two halves of the shrouds together. What this accomplished was that the fastening mechanism would not require a secondary tool to undo it, and it simplified the wheel shroud design itself. The latches can be screwed into or ahered with epoxy to the shroud and that would be the whole mechanism, which leaves the shroud halves as two bowls that come together. The simplicity of this new design will make vacuum-forming a lot easier and make for a more elegant solution. This latch from McMaster was chosen as an initial option. The safest and most viable solution for fastening the latches to the shrouds will likely be some form of adhesive, which I decided on after consulting with 3M. We came to the conclusion that this was the best epoxy for the application that we needed. When a viable fabrication method for the shrouds is secured, these secondary components can then be ordered.

One area of improvement for the fastening of the two halves is the addition of a lip that would allow for a more secure fit and prevent the edges of the two halves from slipping past each other. The issue here then becomes that it is likely very difficult to fabricate a lip that is thin and has the same curvature as the shroud itself all in one piece. A quick thought was to have various lips that could be evenly spread around the edge of the shroud, but this would likely leave gaps in the sections that did not have a lip connection.

2018-2019 Wheel Shroud Information

The wheel shrouds for Black Mamba were designed to be able to be fabricated out of either wet layup carbon fibre, or vacuum formed ABS Plastic. That being said, vacuum forming molds must be scaled up to 101% of the intended size of the part to account for the part shrinking as it cools after being removed from the mold.&#x20;

Mold Information

The molds were machined at WeCutFoam out of a large block of wood that we created out of cut and glued 2x4s. If you are planning to make your shrouds out of carbon fibre with no intentions of vacuum forming, don’t do this. I would recommend making the molds out of MDF, High Density 15lb Urethane, or Modulan

* Molds must be sealed with a thick (ideally the surface will feel smooth and indistinguishable from a solid block of epoxy) layer of West Systems epoxy resin, then freecoated. Since the draft angle of the molds is pretty low, take the wheel shroud off of the mold before it is fully cured. At room temperature this should happen around the 90min mark.&#x20;

A few things to note about the design of the wheel shroud molds:

* The raised concentric “ribs” have the purpose of stiffening the shroud once it is taken off of the mold. In order to verify that the shroud is stiff enough, a resonant frequency of >40Hz should be demonstrated in FEA (in your material of choice). A resonant frequency of about 35Hz was demonstrated in 1/16” ABS. These FEAs were likely incorrectly set up though, which I will elaborate on later. The mold elements (pictured)  that would provide the negative space for the shroud fasteners were designed to be modular so that different versions of the wheel shrouds could be made with the same mold (to fix interference issues).  The tilted “plus” on the top face of the mold and the 12 “nubs” are alignment features. The plus is at the same angle as the upright and the nubs were intended to be bolting locations. For future shrouds, more alignment features should be put onto the mold so that the shroud is more easily aligned when being put onto the car.&#x20;

Fastener Information

The wheel shroud halves are fastened together by a sliding magnetic locking mechanism. It is designed so that when the male reaches the end of the slot in the female, the magnets fitted into the circular depression line up and lock the shrouds together.

Simulation

I ran FEAs in Ansys in order to try to determine how stiff the final shrouds would be, but I ran into issues with excessive deformation during my studies. The only studies that yielded usable data were the resonant frequency simulations, which treated the top face of the “nubs” as being fixed, as the bolt locations were originally intended to be there. On future shrouds, this analysis should be done with the cutout in the inner shroud, as well as the halves of the shrouds fastened together. This setup may also help to fix the issues with excessive deformation during FEA.&#x20;

Fabrication

* Molds must be sealed with a thick layer of epoxy, then freecoated. Wheel shrouds were made out of two layers of twill carbon.Each sheet of carbon was laid on a table and coated with epoxy before being pressed onto the mold. It is very important that the entire sheet of carbon has epoxy on it, as any dry spots will make the shroud difficult to salvage. The wet layup stack was vacuum bagged to the table that the mold was sitting on.The vacuum bag stack for wet layup is:layup itselfpeel plyperforated release film breatherregular release filmbreather againstretchy dark green vac bagBe sure to take the shroud off of the mold before it is fully cured (at about 90-120 minutes depending on temperature). This prevents the shroud from cracking. The shrouds should then be set to fully cure face down on a flat table to prevent them from warping. (see ‘Wheel Covers’ for images of a similar setup)
