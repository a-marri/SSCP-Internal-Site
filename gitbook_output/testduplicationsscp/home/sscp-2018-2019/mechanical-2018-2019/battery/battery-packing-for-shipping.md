## Battery Packing for Shipping

The battery stores significant energy and is at risk of corrosion during transport in an ocean atmosphere. Teams have been known to have their battery pack totally destroyed by corrosion, ending their race before they even start

The following steps are an amalgamation of memories from Logan Herrera and Harry Johnson. They were implemented for the Race Pack (Black) this year. Additional information based on analysis or experience would be great additions.

* Discharge battery pack to state of charge optimal for long term storage (30%) or state of charge requested by transport entity.Remove battery management system. Collect all mounting hardware in a single bag and seal so none can be lost.Tape all exposed connectors and leads thoroughly - the objective is to keep them insulated for weeksIf there is an internal link in the pack, remove it. Collect mounting hardware in a bag and seal. The objective is to lower the maximum potential between any two points. This both reduces the maximum rate of corrosion possible and reduces the maximum energy available from any conductors. This does not go so far as to disconnect collector plates.Take "Before" photos for comparison later in case of concern something has transpired during shipping. Be overzealous. Upload them somewhere other than your phone.

1. Tape breather material around latch pins. This is a cushion to prevent the latch pins from puncturing the plastic bag.
2. Use vacuum film and vacuum tape to construct a bag around the battery box
3. Insert plentiful desiccant
4. Seal bag.  Optional: try to pull a vacuum on the bag in order to locate leaks and remove air.  Realistically even a non-leaky vacuum will not hold completely for all the time spent in shipping, but it will greatly increase the working life of the desiccant before it reaches saturation.
5. Take final photos
6. Pack into sturdy box
7. Full send!
