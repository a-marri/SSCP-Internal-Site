General Info:

Series-parallel

* The series-parallel configuration of the battery pack was chosen to maximize the pack energy while allowing the car to operate at an efficient range of voltages. Per WSC regulations, 20kgs are allowed for lithium ion battery cells, so this was the upper constraint for cell mass. While deciding on the series parallel count, a few different cells were considered:

&#x20;  &#x20;

&#x20;   1\) Sony VTC6: This cell was donated to us by Lucid Motors. As a power cell used for their Formula E battery packs, their relatively low capacity was                unsuited for our use.

&#x20;   2\) Panasonic 18650GA: This cell was used for the Sundae cycle battery packs.&#x20;

&#x20;   3\) Tesla Model 3 2170: Early in the cycle, we looked at the possibility of having battery cells donated from Tesla.&#x20;

&#x20;   4\) Samsung 50E INR 2170: This is the cell that we eventually used, a 2170 cell with a nominal capacity of 5000mAh and a specific energy of 260Wh/kg.       &#x20;

* To my knowledge, this is the first time that SSCP has used 2170 cells. Considering a pack built of 2170s, each cell dropped for the purpose of satisfying a clean s-p count has a greater impact because it contains more energy than an 18650. A pack built of 2170s, however, at our desired nominal voltage, contains 288 cells, just one short of the max 289.&#x20;
* An important part of determining the s-p configuration is the fact that the pack voltage is tied to the series count. Because the HV system efficiency is highly dependent on the pack voltage, this was considered in determining the s-p configuration.

Packaging & Weight Placement

* The 2019 cycle was the first time that SSCP has designed a narrow, single-fairing bullet car. Due to the tricky vehicle dynamics of a narrow track width, the goal of the battery pack's weight distribution was to place its center of gravity as low as possible. Given the geometry of the surrounding wheel wells, the modules were designed and packaged so that all cells that could fit were placed in the bottom row of the pack. This resulted in a "two-story" style of pack structure, resulting in modules on both stories mounted with vertically oriented cells to a centrally located horizontal panel. The enclosure was built with two lids so that modules could be accessed on both stories
