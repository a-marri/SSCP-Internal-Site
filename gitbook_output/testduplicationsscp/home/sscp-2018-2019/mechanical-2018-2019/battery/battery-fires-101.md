It is very possible for a pack to explode without any warning signs like a temperature increase, especially in the case of a short across the pack.  Batteries are a huge thermal mass so it is extremely difficult to cool them down.  If temperatures are increasing rapidly, stop what you are doing, remove load from the battery, and monitor temperatures.  If they continue rising rapidly, especially past 80 deg C, you are in the danger zone.  Even if your batteries don't explode, temperatures over 80 degrade the capacity and life of the cells.

When a battery pack begins to explode, you may see smoke and will definitely hear loud pops.  Think bubble wrap, but significantly louder.  When the battery enters thermal runaway, it will build up pressure and pop a seal within the cell that separates the positive and negative ends.  If you are unlucky, the pressure and temperature in these cells will rise too quickly and the cell casing will explode, venting flaming electrolyte.  This is why nail tests are super important, as a single cell on fire is much easier to deal with than an entire pack.

Once the pack is on fire, before you try and fight/contain it, the most important step is to quickly save what you can before the fire intensifies.  The chain of "saving" things is as follows:

1. driver (and any other people)

2. car

3. garage/trailer

Items 2 and/or 3 should only be saved if, within the responder's best judgement, doing so does not pose a significant risk to the lives/bodies of the responders.  In the case of the Black Mamba battery fire, one person was able to remove the battery fairing after the driver was out, two people removed the pack from the car, and a third person pushed the car away and they let the pack burn.  Since the responders were wearing proper PPE and understood at what point the fire was no longer "safe" to be around, they followed the chain of saving correctly.

While the pack is on fire, the purpose of your safety equipment is as follows:

* Respirators, vapor type - People responding to/fighting the fire and anyone who breathes near the waste until it is disposed of, must wear a respirator.  The fumes from the battery fire are highly toxic.Safety glasses - If you are not wearing a full-face respirator, wear a half-face respirator and safety glasses.  Exploding cells can be launched or throw shrapnel, you don't want this in your eyes.PVC gloves (in the event of an electrolyte leak) - These should just be used after the fire is out and you are cleaning up the remains.  PVC gloves can melt in the fire, thus melting to your skin and burning you.Fire retardant/100% cotton clothing and gloves - Things like welding jackets and gloves should be worn if you can throw them on quickly enough.  These will allow you to stick your hands into hot places (like to pull the latch to remove the pack) and will not melt to your skin.Fire blanket - This is used to extinguish people/things that are on fire, not the batteries.  The battery fire will just burn the blanket.Fire extinguisher (ABC) - Again, not used to extinguish battery fire, just used to extinguish anything else the batteries have set on fire/battery enclosure.Sand - This is the only thing that may help you smother the fire and keep it from spreading.  If you manage to pour sand on the fire without putting your body in harms way, be careful during clean up and make sure to douse the sand in water, as there may still be hot/burning cells in the sand.Shovel and containment box - Used to shovel waste into a secure container until you can properly dispose of it.  In the Black Mamba case, we kept the waste with us from Darwin to Adelaide and weren't able to dispose of it until the day before we left Australia.  Box should be large enough to hold the entire pack's worth of waste and then some.WATER - Although you have been taught to keep water away from electronics for fear of electric shock, at this point the system has already shorted and electrical connections have been broken.  Water actually neutralizes the lithium in a battery fire, so it will actually put it out.  Use any kind of water on hand and call the fire dept, they have LOTS of water, which you will need to douse an entire pack.  This also goes for cases in which you may be assembling a pack and short a cell or module and cause it to enter thermal runaway - put it on the floor/outside, dump water on it, then dispose of later.
* Respirators, vapor type - People responding to/fighting the fire and anyone who breathes near the waste until it is disposed of, must wear a respirator.  The fumes from the battery fire are highly toxic.
* Safety glasses - If you are not wearing a full-face respirator, wear a half-face respirator and safety glasses.  Exploding cells can be launched or throw shrapnel, you don't want this in your eyes.
* PVC gloves (in the event of an electrolyte leak) - These should just be used after the fire is out and you are cleaning up the remains.  PVC gloves can melt in the fire, thus melting to your skin and burning you.
* Fire retardant/100% cotton clothing and gloves - Things like welding jackets and gloves should be worn if you can throw them on quickly enough.  These will allow you to stick your hands into hot places (like to pull the latch to remove the pack) and will not melt to your skin.
* Fire blanket - This is used to extinguish people/things that are on fire, not the batteries.  The battery fire will just burn the blanket.
* Fire extinguisher (ABC) - Again, not used to extinguish battery fire, just used to extinguish anything else the batteries have set on fire/battery enclosure.
* Sand - This is the only thing that may help you smother the fire and keep it from spreading.  If you manage to pour sand on the fire without putting your body in harms way, be careful during clean up and make sure to douse the sand in water, as there may still be hot/burning cells in the sand.
* Shovel and containment box - Used to shovel waste into a secure container until you can properly dispose of it.  In the Black Mamba case, we kept the waste with us from Darwin to Adelaide and weren't able to dispose of it until the day before we left Australia.  Box should be large enough to hold the entire pack's worth of waste and then some.
* WATER - Although you have been taught to keep water away from electronics for fear of electric shock, at this point the system has already shorted and electrical connections have been broken.  Water actually neutralizes the lithium in a battery fire, so it will actually put it out.  Use any kind of water on hand and call the fire dept, they have LOTS of water, which you will need to douse an entire pack.  This also goes for cases in which you may be assembling a pack and short a cell or module and cause it to enter thermal runaway - put it on the floor/outside, dump water on it, then dispose of later.

Now that you have extinguished the fire/let it burn out and shoveled it into a box,  you may want to hold onto it for a few days in order to sift through the waste.  When you do so, go through every piece of waste and take photos of/document everything.  You don't want to miss something and then dump the waste, because you won't be able to go back.  In Adelaide, we dumped the waste at Cleanaway and it cost about $840 AUD.  Other teams we talked to said they contacted the local fire department, who directed them to a dump site.  Dumping can be a long process with a lot of paperwork, so don't start once you are ready to dump.  Start looking as soon as the waste is picked up so that by the time you dig through all the waste and get it to a major city, you already have the paper work completed.
