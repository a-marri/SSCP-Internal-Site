2018-2019 Front Suspension

\[insert pics]

&#x20;\- Main changes from Sundae&#x20;

&#x20;       \- Rear wheel drive

&#x20;       \- solid aluminum upper control arm

&#x20;       \- inboard mounting scheme&#x20;

&#x20;       \- Different Geometry (see subpage)

&#x20;       \- compressed steering system

&#x20;       \- New Hubs to accomodate new uprights

* Strengths&#x20;

&#x20;   \- Clean and simple aluminum control arms

&#x20;   \- Well packaged into small space

&#x20;   \- Lighter than Sundae (largely due to not having a motor)&#x20;

&#x20;   \- Sway bar mount option

&#x20;   \- All insert holes (except some for lower control arm) on one waterjet cut chassis panel

&#x20;       \- This helps define the geometry of the suspension very accurately relative to itself&#x20;

Weaknesses

&#x20;   \- Steering system has many joints that create compliance

&#x20;   \- Large components to counteract high forces due to leading arm design and having to go around the steered tire

&#x20;   \- Upper control arm hardpoints mounted in pull (really bad)

&#x20;   \- steering system hardpoints mounted in pull&#x20;

&#x20;   \- Chassis bulkhead not well supported

&#x20;   \- not easy to adjust aligntment that isn't toe

Main Decisions:

The front suspension was designed to be leading arm supsension derived from Sundae's front suspension. Back in the initial design stages when we were trying to package the bullet car, we had wanted to emulate some of the other bullet car designs that try to separate the mechancial car from the aerobody. This led us to want to essentially build a box around the driver and then mount the full suspension to that box. This was in conjuction with the original idea of making a tub chassis. Given the narrow gemetry of the car, the packaging worked better for a leading arm style suspension rather than a double A arm as we would have to build a strong sturcture between the tires to handle all of the loads of the suspension.

This ended up being a poor decision given that we loaded the front bulkhead in pull for most of the front suspension mounting. This lead to core crushing problems after the mechanical shake down testing. Do not load your suspension hardpoints in pull. Its just a bad idea.&#x20;

The decision to move to rear wheel drive was to alleviate some of the packaging challenges and complexity in the front suspension. The motors are large and bulky and we were initially having trouble packaging the shocks, steering system, and a center chassis structure to mount the shocks too with the motor in place. Given the low torque of our motors we were not too concerned about oversteer due to RWD however it did negatively impact our weight balance.&#x20;

We moved the pickup points of the control arms to be more inboard in comparison to Sundae. This reduced the stresses and defomormation in the control arms as it did not have to wrap around the tire as much.

2018-2019 Rear Suspension

Main changes from Sundae&#x20;

&#x20;\- Thin Walled welded tubing trailing arm

&#x20;\- inboard mounting

&#x20;\- Rear wheel drive

Strengths&#x20;

&#x20;   \- Light

&#x20;   \- predominately in house fabrication

&#x20;   \- Cheap materials

Weaknesses&#x20;

&#x20;   \- No easy way to adjust any aligmnet (toe biggest problem)

&#x20;   \- motor mounting plate machined out of house but would be a pain in the arse to make

&#x20;   \- Tolerances on the welded arm were not perfect

&#x20;   \- minimal clearance on shock mount on trailing arm for driver side?&#x20;

&#x20;       \- When I mirrored the trailing arm, I mirrored the motor housing as well when the motor housing is not actually mirrored

The rear suspension was also derived from Sundae. We liked the simplicity of the trailing arm with only one main member. In moving the motor to the rear, we figured we could use the structure of the motor to add stiffness to the trailing arm. In addition we moved to a steel tubing trailing arm. This was an effort to counteract the large torsional moment on the trailing arm due to cornering forces. This is the highest loading case. The thin walled steel tubing came out lighter than the aluminum interations and lighter than Sunadaes version.&#x20;

The rear hardpoints were mounted all in pull on one panel. This created large problems with chassis damage on the rear bulkhead. See more on the rear suspension subpage.&#x20;
