How to Design an Upright!!!

&#x20;   1\) Get 3D points in space from the suspension

* Define hard pointsUpper ball jointLower ball jointSteering (tie rod)Push rodMake sure to draw lines for control arms to check clearanceLabel the points with different colors so you know which one is the upper and lower control armI've made the mistake of designing the upright upside down the first time so pls check!!

&#x20;   2\) Define where hub needs to go-draw a 3D plane there + 6 3D points for the hub fixture fasteners

* This plane needs to be perpendicular to "ground" even if the upright isn't!

&#x20;   3\) Connect the dots!! Using the hub plane, extrude a huge section that encompasses all the hard points. Make it thiccc

&#x20;   4\) Cut away the sides&#x20;

&#x20;   5\) Keep cutting away the sides&#x20;

* Label the cuts as you make by the plane you cut with (x, y, z) so when you have to go back and change things, it'll be easy to find

* Use equations!!!Minimum thickness for manufacturing (0.150" rule of thumb)Bolt head size (for clearance)Bolt shank/thread diameteretcWith simulation, we learned that the double support (double shear) doesn't do much to support the upper/lower hard point bolts - doesn't result in that much more stiffness or that much less deflection or that much less stress on the boltsRemember to check for clearance for the control arms

&#x20;   9\) Fillet everything, and define an equation with that too! Fillet = less stress concentrations

&#x20;  &#x20;

&#x20;   10\) Model (or copy) aurora bearings to make sure everything fits&#x20;

&#x20;   REPEAT THE NEXT COUPLE STEPS UNTIL YOU MEET THE RIGHT FOS AND DEFLECTION CRITERIA

&#x20;   11\) Simulate!

&#x20;   12\) Add lightning holes where FOS > 2. For reference, 2019 front upright was \~3lbs&#x20;
