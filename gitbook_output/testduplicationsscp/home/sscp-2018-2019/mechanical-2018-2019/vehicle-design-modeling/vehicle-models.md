# SSCP - Vehicle Models

# Vehicle Models

Goals: Write (and later validate) a set of vehicle models to inform and provide feedback for full-vehicle design, with particular focus on stability and behavior under various driving conditions.

Code is posted on the team Github (ask Sarah/Maggie/Ella for access) in the solardrift repo.

The initial model we're starting out with (as of end of summer 2018) is a bicycle model with aerodynamic forces/moments added into the state derivatives. We're focusing on testing our Pacejka tire model and attempting to predict response to various crosswinds while driving.
