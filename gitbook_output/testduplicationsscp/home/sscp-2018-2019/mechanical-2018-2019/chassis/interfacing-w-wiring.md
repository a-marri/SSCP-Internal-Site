# SSCP - Interfacing w/ Wiring

# Interfacing w/ Wiring

Last cycle: used rubber grommets with metal edges from sealsit.com. EE team likes these but they're really expensive ($16+ ea, depending on size).  EE team did *not* like the all-rubber push in style grommets, probably because we didn't manage to find any that were sized for a 5/8" panel.

most promising looking grommet options are 

* 1.5" outer diameter with 1" of rubber, punch your own hole3" outer diameter with 1.25" prepunched hole in 2.25" of rubber, or punch your own hole4" outer diameter with 1.8" prepunched hole in 3" of rubber, or punch your own
* 1.5" outer diameter with 1" of rubber, punch your own hole
* 3" outer diameter with 1.25" prepunched hole in 2.25" of rubber, or punch your own hole
* 4" outer diameter with 1.8" prepunched hole in 3" of rubber, or punch your own

* 1.5" outer diameter with 1" of rubber, punch your own hole

* 4" outer diameter with 1.8" prepunched hole in 3" of rubber, or punch your own

1.5" outer diameter with 1" of rubber, punch your own hole

3" outer diameter with 1.25" prepunched hole in 2.25" of rubber, or punch your own hole

4" outer diameter with 1.8" prepunched hole in 3" of rubber, or punch your own

Planning on picking two sizes (small and large) to use throughout the chassis, and leaning towards the 1.5" and 3" sizes pending input from EE team. Tritiums + VC all live in the same compartment (abbreviating this as EEC) right above the battery so wiring between them is easy. List of wire-routing channels is as follows:

* Battery-> all goes through large potted openings in the EE shelf/dashboard shelf. No grommets necessaryTritium 1 -> motor leftwill go straight back out of EEC to motor, this bundle will have its own dedicated grommetsTritium 2 -> motor rightwill go back out of EEC and then across car, this bundle will have its own dedicated grommetsVC -> steering wheelgoes forward out of EEC, across car, then back to driver, will have own dedicated grommetsfront lights -> ? (are these on topshell?) where do the lights connect to, the VC?mid lights -> ? rear lights -> ? (has to be on topshell)VC/steering wheel -> misc nose shelf (GPS/Antennae)channels will run forward from both driver and EEC, meet in the centerline of the car, and then forward to nose (own grommets out of EEC/Dr.Cmpt and then share grommets to the front?VC -> shelf under canopy rear (GPS/Antennae) (tbd if this is attached to the topshell)planning on running backwards from EEC, across car and then upcan this share a grommet with brake lines? can also have its ownrearview cam -> steering wheel only? (does this need to route to the EE shelf?)
