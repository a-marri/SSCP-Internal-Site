# Intro:

[](#h.rnw1pshoak4c)

In order to minimize the risk of rolling during dynamic testing, our team fit both front and rear training wheels onto the car. These consisted of plywood and 2x4 frames with fixed angle casters positioned slightly outside the wheelbase of the car. Relative heights were measured from the center of the axles and adjusted to establish the desired maximum roll angle.

# Hardware:

[](#h.8kpnautb22b9)

We used high impact fixed angle casters (McMaster 30305T63) and wood screws as well as ⅜” threaded rod cut to length and used with accompanying hardware as pseudo long bolts.

# Rear Wheels:

The rear training wheels were designed as a relatively simple T-beam that rested on the bottom of the aero body on two spacers. It was held in place by another piece of plywood bolted on from below, as well as a spacer that wedged it between the rear edge of the fairing doors and the center chassis panel. The ends of the T-beam had to be cut and offset to account for a lower than anticipated wheel height.

# Front Wheels:

The front training wheels followed the same general layout and hardware principles, however their location added constraints to their design. Two M-shaped plywood panels were cut and screwed together in order to sandwich the front bulkhead. Diagonal braces were added both over and through the front fairing doors and platforms were fixed to the feet of the ‘M’ to hold the casters.
