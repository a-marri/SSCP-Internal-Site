## Pull Test Setup

In order to determine the strength of bearing press fits, we developed a very high tech test fixture consisting of a crane scale, ratchet straps, and vail.  Two “coupons” were used to hold the bearings in a way that would allow them to be pulled apart.  One coupon was a square tube of aluminum, with one large hole in the middle that is larger than the OD of the bearing, but smaller than the outer area of the suspension component it is pressed in.  Next to the large hole are two smaller holes (thru holes for either #10 or 1/4”) that are used to attach the fake suspension rectangle that the bearing is pressed in.  The opposite coupon has one hole that is a thru hole for the size of the bolt that goes thru the bearing.  This way, the bolt goes thru the bearing and into the second coupon, then a nut goes on the other side.  This coupon is actually a rectangular tube so that the ratchet strap can easily wrap thru it.

One large ratchet strap is wrapped around “ground” (a pillar at vail) and thru the second coupon.  For the first coupon/suspension side, our scale only went up to 600 lbs, so we used three ratchet straps in parallel, assuming a 600lb reading on the scale would be 1800lbs total.  These three ratchet straps were connected to one larger strap, which wrapped around another pillar at vail.  Yoga mats were placed under the scale and suspension components so that they would not be damaged from hitting the ground.

What happened:  The fake suspension rectangles that we made and pressed bearings into were not able to be tested because they could be popped out by hand.  We believe this was due to the fact that loctite was not used and the diameter was not manufactured to the proper specification; this led to the “press fit” being a “K7” fit with zero interference.  In the video, we pull tested the same bearings that had been pressed into the sundae suspension components with loctite.  The maximum force read on the scale was 142lbs, so the pull out force of the bearing was approximately 426lbs. To improve the test setup, a scale with a larger limit or even the same scale could have been used in series with one ratchet strap instead of having the three parallel straps in series with one.  Having the three straps was not the best because it was difficult to properly tension all three straps to the same pretension force.
