# SSCP - Bubble

# Bubble

The bubble/canopy was manufactured out of 0.125" thick cast acrylic by Aircraft Windshield Company (www.aircraftwindshield.com, POC Jesica Broderson Jesica@aircraftwindshield.com). Coatings applied were hardcoat (scratch resistance) and a UV coating. With the UV coating used, we just barely passed optical clarity at scrutineering - consider using a lighter coating in the future. Other optical qualities were very good.

Invoice is attached; the cost for machining the molds was 60-70% of total cost. The windshields were manufactured with 1/2" trim around the outside edge for easy attaching to the rest of the car.

We ended up modifying our first design to reduce curvature around the tail end of the bubble for license plate distortion reasons. This also just squeaked by, so try not to get any pointier than this bubble in the future.
