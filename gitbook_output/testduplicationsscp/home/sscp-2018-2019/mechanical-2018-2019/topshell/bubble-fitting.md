# Intro:

[](#h.l8dcpgsgya4k)

This document explains the process of fitting the front and back acrylic bubbles into their carbon surroundings as carried out by the 2019 mechanical team. This included a front windshield (which attached to a removable canopy) as well as a rear window (which attached directly to the top-shell).

# Fitting the Housings:

[](#h.w0x92x5u5n42)

Before the acrylic itself was fit, the surrounding carbon had to be trimmed in order to establish a consistent edge thickness. After the acrylic was centered and temporarily clamped in place, it could be traced onto the surface of the carbon. In places where this line intersected areas of Nomex sandwich, the inner carbon layer was carefully cut with a Dremel and pried out with the help of a chisel. Excess Nomex was also removed with a spindle sanding bit. Places where the carbon itself exceeded this edge thickness also had to be carefully sanded down with this bit.

# Fitting the Bubbles:

The edges of the carbon were first covered in masking tape to prevent Sharpie bleed into the vinyl. We then clamped (using the techniques mentioned in the next section) the bubble as close to its final position as possible and traced the shape of the carbon edge onto the acrylic. Once removed from the topshell, this line was matched by a strip of duct tape in order to protect the middle of the acrylic from Dremel scratches (and later epoxy). The exposed edge of the bubble was then cut along this line with a dremel grinding wheel, cutting only to a depth that matched the thickness of the carbon (a slow spindle speed works well for this) and being extremely cautious not to overshoot this depth (which would undermine the robustness of the bubble). Once this line was scored, a spindle sanding bit was used to carefully remove the rest of the edge (down to the same thickness). This thickness was checked against the top-shell sporadically and adjusted where necessary. Though, in this case, this process was done entirely by hand, it may be possible to design a jig that assures at least a consistent thickness. If done with a Dremel, it is important to ensure that the hand holding the tool is always also in contact with the material being cut.

# Gluing/Clamping the Bubbles:

[](#h.cgqvowsdd4f2)

After masking all areas susceptible to glue squeeze-out, we used the carbon surface prepping procedure for the acrylic as well as the carbon. We then spread DP-420 onto the acrylic lip using a popsicle stick before finally clamping it into place.

We were able to clamp the front bubble independently using long-reach C-clamps padded with breather (to prevent scratching). For added and more even force, we also used internal bar clamps. To give these more traction against the bubble’s irregular surface, we wrapped strips of duct tape around short lengths of rod and stuck them to the acrylic. Excess epoxy was removed with IPA.

The rear bubble had to be glued in place, taking special care not to damage the array (it was protected by sheets of printer paper draped over it). The same surface prep and glue spreading procedures from the front bubble were used, though the fitting process was much more complicated. With the canopy in place, held up by supports clamped to the top-shell and blocks supported and adjusted by a pallet jack, the bubble could be lifted into place from below and raised by a vertical internal bar clamp until it was flush with the canopy. A horizontal internal bar clamp (using the same duct tape-dowel pads as before) was then used to push the acrylic corners into place. A plywood wedge (with duct tape to increase static friction) forced into the back of the bubble secured the rest of the horizontal seam (many of these apparatuses were supported by the same pallet jack, which had a large crate on top of it. After the canopy was removed, extra clamps were added to secure the corners.

# Potting:

[](#h.l7todditm14m)

To account for any gaps or inaccuracies in the bubble’s fit, we added a narrow/thin strip of potting compound on top of the seam. This was masked with two pieces of tape that were spaced apart by the same distance as the maximum gap in the seam. A ribbon of potting compound was smeared along this gap, using a wide popsicle stick to make it as thin and smooth as possible.
