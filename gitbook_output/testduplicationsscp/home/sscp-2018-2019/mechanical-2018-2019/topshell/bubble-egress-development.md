## SSCP - Bubble Egress Development

## Bubble Egress Development

The purpose of this page is to document the ideation, prototyping, and development of the 2019 cycle bubble egress system. In our final system, the driver slides the bubble backwards off of its placement rails and pulls themselves up by the dashboard chassis panel. As they rise, suction cups on the crown of the helmet connect to the top of the bubble, and allow it to follow them attached to their head as they leave the car.

Design Objective

We needed to create a bubble egress system so that a driver could exit the car in 12 seconds to comply with the rules of the corresponding scrutineering test. The considerations for this system included that it needed to not crowd the area under and around the cockpit (containing the bubble latching, roll cage, seatbelt, ect), be easily accessible from the driver’s seated position, leave at least one hand free for the driver to brace themselves on the chassis in order to stand up, and prevent the bubble from falling onto the array while rising (eg. could not hinge over inboard side). We did not want to use the same bubble egress system as Sundae, as their hinging is not very stable and deformation over time would prevent us from being able to keep as tight a seam as possible.

Ideation

Though an obvious initial thought is just to put a handle on either side of the bubble so a driver could just lift it up, it is not possible to rise out of the cockpit without pulling yourself up on the dashboard chassis panel. Our first plan was to indeed mount a handle on only one underside of the bubble, and have a sleeve on the other side that a driver’s arm could pass through and grab the handle. This would allow the driver to support the bubble on both with only one arm.

We did not use this system because it was difficult for a driver to pass their arm through this way from their seated position.

Our second plan, and initial prototype consisted of a harness going from the underside of the bubble, around the drivers arms, and secured around their waist like a belt along with a traction material on top of the helmet. As the driver rose out of their seat, the bubble was lifted by the helmet, and kept from tilting via the taught harness straps. For our prototype, we used 3M type B rubber gasket on the helmet and ratchet straps hotglued to cardboard mounts for the harness.

The prototype was overall successful, however the traction of the rubber gasket was rather weak. We ordered nylon straps and suction cups as a replacement traction to continue prototyping.

&#x20;Final execution

When the parts came in for further developing the harness + bubble traction system, we found that the suction cups alone were sufficient for bubble egress. 9 suction cups are placed in 3 lines of 3 along the crown of the helmet. When a driver stands up with sufficient force, enough of these cups connect to the top of the bubble to hold it in place on the drivers head- even allowing them to turn their head with the bubble staying in place. We were worried about if the heat in the cockpit might deform the suction cups such that they fall off the helmet, but after pointing a blowdryer directly over a suction cup for several minutes no deformation occurred. The suction cups are strong but can be removed from the helmet by prying up a corner and peeling them off, so they leave no damage or permanent hardware on the helmet.&#x20;
