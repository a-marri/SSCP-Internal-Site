Seam Filling:

This document explains the measures taken by the 2019 mechanical team to fill and realign substantial gaps between the top-shell and bottom-shell. We used West Systems resin with potting filler to bridge gaps of up to ½”. 

To avoid permanent adhesion and glue spills, we covered the seam and ledge of the bottom-shell with teflon tape, also attaching an apron of release film to protect the surroundings. We then cleaned the edge of the topshell with IPA and moved it into place on the bottom-shell ledge, centering the seam as best as possible. We mixed the potting compound to an extra thick consistency, assuring that it would not flow once squeezed into the seam. Using popsicle sticks, we spread the potting compound as densely as possible between the two edges and made sure to leave plenty of excess protruding from the seam. Note that in places without a ledge, the bottom of the seam will be open to the inside of the car. This should not pose any problems however, provided the potting compound is of sufficient viscosity. 

Once dry, we carefully peeled off the top-shell by pushing up from inside the wheel cutouts. Once the teflon and release film were removed, we returned the top-shell to its position and sanded the excess potting compound flush, using Bondo to fill pockets where necessary.
