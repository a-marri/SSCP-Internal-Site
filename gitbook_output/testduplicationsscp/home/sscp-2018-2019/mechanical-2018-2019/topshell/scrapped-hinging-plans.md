# SSCP - Scrapped Hinging Plans

# Scrapped Hinging Plans

In order to allow for better normalization at control stops, we originally planned to use some sort of hinging to fix the car's topshell at various angles. These are our initial plans, and the reasons we didn't pursue them further.

At first, we thought that using springs and a retractable pen-type mechanism would help with getting the topshell out of the bottomshell. However, we determined that the amount of overlap between the top and bottom shells would prevent this kind of push-click mechanism from working.

At the time the idea was scrapped, we had settled on a slide-and-hinge idea, in which the topshell would slide on rails to some sort of end-point and would then hinge up and out. The topshell would latch to the bottomshell in the closed position, and would remain unlatched when hinged. We had not come up with a way to fixture the topshell at various angles by the time we moved on from this idea.

Though this idea never got far in development, it may be worth investigating further for future cycles.

Our next approach to hinging was to use a four-bar linkage, connected on two hardpoints each on the front and rear bulkhead panels. We attempted to use a laser level and three "crosshairs" cutouts to align the rear bulkhead panel with the front panel. After a full day's work trying to get the rear panel aligned with the front panel, we scrapped this idea, too. We were simply unable to use the laser level to align the two panels, likely because the front bulkhead itself was slightly off when we epoxy-ed it into the car. Essentially, we were unable to attach a four-bar linkage in a way that would not put unwanted force on the chassis panels. If we chose to continue, the chassis panels would progressively break more and more every time the linkage was used. It may be worth pursuing an alternative alignment strategy for manufacturing a future four-bar linkage for connecting topshell and bottomshell.
