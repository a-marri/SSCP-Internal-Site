have tossed around 'mobile weather station' ideas but made no serious effort here. No luck getting on-ground station sponsorship from understory.&#x20;

Goals: implement & integrate a predictive weather model into the race strategy algorithm (basic); include some sort of accounting for uncertainty (advanced)
