Current Status

- We can communicate with the SolarGIS API to get GHI, DHI, DNI, TEMP, and WS(windspeed) for any given lat/lon and day (must be forecasts from 0-10 days ahead)

Next Steps:

- Just found John Bolander's compilation of models including a Solar Insolation and Solar Power Model. Will try to implement these models using the parameters that we have.
